    "description": "Lifetime has picked-up the reality series Abby's Ultimate Dance Competition, headlined by Dance Moms' Abby Lee Miller, which will feature 12 of the country's most talented girl and boy dancers competing for a $100,000 cash prize and a scholarship to the Young Dancer Program at the Joffrey Ballet School in New York. Joining Miller at the judges table will be Robin Antin, founder of the pop group sensation Pussycat Dolls, and dancer and cutting-edge celebrity choreographer Richard Jackson. Kevin Manno will host. Abby's Ultimate Dance Competition will begin by following a dozen aspiring dancers -- ages six through 13 - who will learn new routines and compete in a number of challenges designed to test their skills when they perform before Miller, Antin and Jackson, as well as a live audience, at the historic Los Angeles Theatre. Along the way, each competitor will be accompanied and coached by his or her own mother, who will make critical training, costume, music and choreographic decisions for their child while also navigating the precarious waters of the other highly competitive parents. As Miller, Antin and Jackson must make the sometimes easy and other times difficult decision to eliminate one dancer each week, the intense on stage competition and stakes between dancers and mothers increase throughout the season - culminating with a finale performance that assuredly will change the winning dancer's life forever."

Its failure stemmed from its uncertain focus on what it means to be Korean in contemporary California society, including the somewhat objectionable casting of Chinese and Japanese actors as Koreans, and from the treatment of standup comic Cho as a rather stereotypical Valley girl on the prowl for boys, in complete contradiction of her popular image as a tough-talking, upfront lesbian. In the latter episodes there was an attempt to shift the show into a show-biz formula, with Cho's character becoming manager of an inept rock band, but to no avail. There was, however, one superb performance: Amy Hill as the proud-to-be-assimilated, straight-talking Korean grandmother. I would have given Hill her own show immediately"

When he looks in the mirror, Allen Gregory De Longpre doesn't see a child. He sees a young man who is intelligent, sophisticated, worldly, artistic and romantic—characteristics he inherited from his doting father, Richard. The pair share an extraordinary father-son bond—a bond that is sometimes annoyingly interrupted by Richard's life partner, Jeremy, for whom Allen Gregory has minimal respect, if any at all. They live together in a stunning architectural loft, along with Julie, Allen Gregory's adopted Cambodian sister. Although Allen Gregory has allegedly composed operas, written novels and dated Chloe Sevigny, he's about to embark on his greatest challenge yet: leaving the safety of his father's homeschooling and attending elementary school with children his own age. His journey will be a struggle, not only with the other kids at school, but with the faculty as well. Whether it's the all-out rivalry with Gina Winthrop, his by-the-book second grade teacher; his unique relationship with Judith Gottlieb, his 68-year-old principal; or his desperate desire to be best friends with Joel Zadak, the school's popular stud, Allen Gregory has his work cut out for him. With the help of his trusty friend and assistant, Patrick Vanderweel; and the support of Superintendent Stewart Rossmyre, who believes the De Longpres are a tremendous asset to the school, Allen Gregory won't have to get his hands too dirty. \"Allen Gregory\" is about an outsider. And while he may put on a tough exterior, deep down, all Allen Gregory wants is to fit in. Well, that, and for Julie to run away and never be seen or heard from again. And Jeremy too."

In her first lead television role, Leifer plays a savvy, single businesswoman who's just opened a Miami optometry shop with best friend Renee. Here, Carol tries to remain sane as she copes with her nearby mother and father, girl-crazy brother and younger sister who seems to be developing a strange liking for Vic Damone. Combine all of this to the many romances of Renee (who has never met a man she didn't like. a lot), and you get a pop culture comedy that finds big laughs in little moments. (WB promo)"

    "description": "Is it possible that intelligent life forms visited Earth thousands of years ago, bringing with them technology that drastically affected the course of history and man’s own development? Presented in the 1968 bestselling book Chariots of the Gods, by Erich von Daniken, the theory of “ancient aliens” rocked people’s beliefs in mankind’s progress. Ancient cave drawings of strange creatures, remains of landing strips in Peru, and Indian texts that describe the “flying machines of the gods” were just a few of the odd archaeological artifacts cited by von Daniken as proof that ancient astronauts were well known to our ancestors. Produced with the exclusive cooperation of von Daniken himself, the documentary series Ancient Aliens launches all-new expeditions to seek out and evaluate this evidence, with a concentration on discoveries of the last 30 years, including unusual DNA findings on man’s evolution and newly decoded artifacts from Egypt to Syria to South America. It is a balanced investigation into a theory some believe cannot be true, but many agree cannot be ignored."

Despite his unorthodox style, George has an undeniable gift with animals of all kinds - except the human kind. Much to his chagrin, George recently learned that his ex-girlfriend, Dorothy Crane (JoAnna Garcia Swisher, Better with You), has inherited the family business and is now George's boss. Whip-smart and ambitious, Dorothy shakes up the hospital as she brings order to the chaos and butts heads with George's animal-friendly administration. Tyler Labine (Reaper, Sons of Tucson) plays Dr. Doug Jackson, a vet who's great with animals, but hapless in matters of the heart; Bobby Lee (Harold & Kumar) stars as Dr. Yamamoto; Kym Whitley (We Bought a Zoo) stars as Juanita; and newcomer Betsy Sodaro (The Nick Show Kroll) stars as Nurse Angela.

It was shown on UK's Channel 4 in October 2001. Each show had a rough theme, often somewhat existentialist in nature, around which Iannucci would weave a series of surreal sketches and monologues. Recurring themes in the episodes are the superficiality of modern culture, our problems communicating with each other, the mundane nature of working life and feelings of personal inadequacy and social awkwardness. Several characters also make repeat appearances in the shows, including the East End thug, who solves every problem with threats of violence; Hugh, an old man who delivers surreal monologues about what things were like in the old days; and Iannucci's barber, who is full of nonsensical anecdotes."

Oliver Tobias gives us a virile and thoughtful Arthur, beset by problems at home and abroad, while Kai, his right hand man, was played by the late Michael Gothard. They are supported by a strong crew working on a limited budget, but in impressive locations. The series was last repeated in the UK in 1983, but at least one video tape of the production is still available - a ninety-minute compilation first issued in 1975 under the title 'King Arthur: Young Warlord'. \"Historians know little that is factual about this period in our history, but upon one thing they are agreed - the legendary picture of Arthur is a fantasy, the truth was different. Camelot was an unlovely encampment of log and thatch within cunning defences.\" - Patrick Dromgoole, Exec"

It aired on Fox Kids from 1990 until 1992 and again in the spring and summer of 1996. It also aired on Fox Family Channel from 1998 to 2000. The series picks up five years after The Great Tomato War (much as the film Return Of The Killer Tomatoes did), where tomatoes are banned. However that hasn't stopped Dr. Putrid T. Gangreen from engaging in his experiments. Gangreen's ultimate goal is to rule the world (like any evil villain, of course) and he won't let anyone stop him. But his most successful experiment may very well be his undoing. Tara Boumdeay, a tomato turned human runs away from Gangreen, taking with her 'Brother' the fur-covered F.T., whom she passes off as a dog. They befriend Chad Finletter (nephew of the Great Tomato War veteran, Wilbur Finletter) who, after saving the pair from a tomato attack, gets Tara a job at his uncle Wilbur's Tomatoless Pizza Parlor. She shares their secret with Chad regarding the two of them being tomatoes and Chad vows to help them against whatever Gangreen has planned. That is where everyone stands at the start of the first episode, \"Give A Little Whistle\", where the evil Doctor sets his new plans into motion (and would continue through the first season). Season Two would center on Gangreen actually conquering the world in the debut episode. But Gangreen learns on a personal level the importance of the quote \"Be careful what you wish for\". He's overthrown by Zoltan and his gang of twice-mutated tomatoes, and is forced to join up with Chad, Tara, Wilbur and the rest of the Tomato Task Force (other vets of the Great Tomato War)."

Austin City Limits was initially created with an eye and ear toward original Texas music, featuring artists that created innovative new sounds in everything from western swing and Texas blues to Tejano music, progressive country and rock n' roll. The series went on to feature a wide range of American roots artists, covering a variety of styles and expanding beyond the borders of the Lone Star State. As the programs audience has grown, the music has encompassed regional, national and even international performers, and producer Terry Lickona continues to seek a balance of music genres in every new season. Austin City Limits today focuses on the unique contributions of diverse artists, music and songwriting from around the world. First aired in 1976, Austin City Limits has become American television's longest-running concert music program. The program is taped live by PBS member station KLRU on the campus of the University of Texas at Austin. Images of Austin, Texas, the self-proclaimed \"Live Music Capital of the World,\" are seen in the opening credits. ACL's set also features a mock skyline of Austin.

When Danny and a group of other athletically-challenged hopefuls fail to make the team, Danny’s disappointment forces Terry to face her past. So when a wealthy neighbor volunteers to finance a team for the rejected kids, Terry reluctantly offers to coach the team of misfits."

He's the teacher who just wants to be everyone's 'best mate' and is prone to massive and very public mishaps. There's also Miss Gulliver, the school biology teacher and the apple of Alfie's eye. She cares deeply about the school and the students. Deputy headmistress Pickwell is less easy-going. She is an 'old school' teacher and can't stand her younger colleagues. She's a disciplinarian who wants Creationism put back on the syllabus and would prefer a school without children at all!"

The close-knit Dowden family includes a colorful cast of characters who each have their own plans for living the American dream. Led by patriarch, Gerald, and matriarch, Kitten, the family includes daughter Valerie, an outspoken, single mother of three who works for the public defender's office in Shreveport; daughter Chantel and her offbeat, live-in boyfriend Albert (aka Carl; aka Jimmy) whose hilarious exploits and anecdotes keep things very, very interesting; adventurous son Gerald Jr. and his wife Peggy; and the youngest son Thomas, who admits to being his mother's favorite, and his wife Mallory.

Two teenage models who are about to discover this world for themselves are Raina Collins, a stunning beauty with a secret past, and Chris Andrews, a strikingly handsome Iowa farm boy. When Raina makes an unforgettable impression at a show introducing the new line from designer Zac Posen, she steals the spotlight from her friend Sonja. Sonja has been out of the country for mysterious reasons and is now desperate to reclaim her standing as the reigning supermodel. While Raina and Sonja live at the top of the fashion food chain, Chris is starting at the bottom, having just been discovered by agent Simon Lockridge of the Covet Modeling Agency, which is owned by former supermodel Claudia Foster. At his first photo shoot, Chris' inexperience almost derails his career until Raina comes to his rescue, showing him how to relax and work the camera. That afternoon, Raina brings Chris to the \"models' residence\" where she lives along with other young hopefuls, including Marissa Delfina, Egan, Issac and the current alpha-male-model known as Kai. At an exclusive industry party that night, Chris is again impressed by Raina's generosity when she steps aside to make sure Sonja lands a job that will resurrect her career. However, after an ugly scene with Simon, Chris is left to question whether he can survive in this world of dangerous excess and fleeting fame."

In every episode, there can be found countless sight gags, puns, parodies, songs, and more, all of which are designed to help kids better understand the pronunciation of everyday words. The setting for the show is, fittingly, a library, where husband-and-wife team Theo and Cleo are the Librarians. Their inquisitive cubs, younger sister Leona and older brother Lionel, often help them out, while another character - the Information Hen - dispenses information to perplexed Library patrons. Among the other colorful characters likely to be encountered, is a statue of the library's founder, Barnaby B. (\"Don't Call Me Buster!\") Busterfield III, who makes sarcastic comments about the silliness he often witnesses going on in the library. There are also two dim-witted pigeons, Clay and Walter (get it?) who hang around the statue, keeping him company - but he just wishes they'd go away! Additi"

    "description": "Beyond Scared Straight is a new series executive produced by Arnold Shapiro and based on his Academy Award and multiple Emmy-Winning documentary \"Scared Straight!,\" that will profile unique approaches to juvenile crime prevention in prisons around the U.S. \"Scared Straight!\" has become an iconic name and a cultural phenomenon over the years. The film made a huge impact - showcasing the radical and effective juvenile intervention program that took place in a New Jersey prison. Since they were created, both the prison program and the film have turned countless kids away from drugs, violence and crime. The power of the original \"Scared Straight!\" program has inspired dozens of inmate-run intervention programs in men's and women's prisons across the country; and this series will showcase several of them. Under the auspices of Arnold Shapiro, \"Beyond Scared Straight\" profiles the new approach to keeping today's kids from becoming tomorrow's convicts. Much like the original version of \"Scared Straight!,\" these youthful offender programs put boys and girls of all ethnicities, ranging in age from 13-18, into intensive one-day in-prison sessions that show them the realities of life behind bars. However, in many dramatic ways, these 21st Century programs are very different from the original because today's youth needs a different approach. For current teens, city streets can be as dangerous as the life they believe exists behind bars. TV, film and music have glorified the gang and prison experience and the task of \"scaring\" teens is more complicated now than ever. As a result, inmates have had to adapt their methods - making them more a combination of intimidation, information and communication - and the results for the new program have proven to be equally effective. Each 60-minute episode of \"Beyond Scared Straight\" will focus on a different prison program in the U.S., following 4 -5 at-risk teens. Viewers will follow them as they attend the program, experience their intensive one-day in-prison session and then follow up with them one-month later to see the lasting impressions the program has left on them."

The series generally constitutes 14 or more contestants who live in an isolated house for several months. Housemates are at all times under the control of Big Brother, a rule enforcing authority figure who monitors behaviour of the housemates, set tasks and punishments and provides the mechanism for contestants to make external requests. Housemates are filmed 24 hours per day with edited highlights broadcast during prime time slots, and late night footage broadcast live. Live footage is also broadcast via the Internet using Internet streaming. Housemates must remain in the house, and avoid being evicted by viewers of the show with the aim of winning a substantial cash prize at the end of the series. In order to support the housemates' well-being, all participants have access to the Big Brother psychologist Carmel Hill, and a doctor, at all times."

Each episode was 15 minutes long, with cliffhanger endings resolved the following week. It became its own series in 1979 with twelve 30-minute episodes. There were a total of 28 episodes produced. \"Bigfoot and Wildboy\" was very similar to five episodes from another ABC series The Six Million Dollar Man, which included Bigfoot, who was the protector of aliens from outer space. Episodes for \"Bigfoot and Wildboy\" are hard to find, even from collectors. Only two releases were available in the 1980s by Embassy Video, \"Bigfoot and Wildboy Volume One\" and \"Bigfoot and Wildboy Volume Two.\" Both are now out of print. Columbia House had released \"The World Of Sid and Marty Krofft\" series, which contained \"Bigfoot and Wildboy\" episodes. Rhino Video released a three-DVD collection also called \"The World Of Sid and Marty Krofft\" in 2002 included \"The Return Of The Vampire\" episode. Cox Cable's \"Retro Saturday Morning\" aired the first eight two-part episodes of \"Bigfoot and Wildboy\" in 2003 and 2004 as part of the second season of the Krofft Supershow. Rhino Video has released some of the other Sid and Marty Krofft series such as H.R. Pufnstuf, The Bugaloos, and Sigmund and the Sea Monsters as DVD collections. When Rhino Video was contacted in 2006, there were no current plans for a DVD-set for the \"Bigfoot and Wildboy\" series. Ray Young, who played \"Bigfoot,\" appeared in many other television shows, including an episode of The Bionic Woman called \"Iron Ships And Dead Men\" on March 30, 1977, but not as Bigfoot. Young died of lung cancer on July 6, 1999. Joseph Butcher, who played \"Wildboy,\" is in the real estate business. In 2004, he appeared in an episode of 55 Degrees North as Jack Timson Jr. Monika Ramirez, who played \"Susie,\" appeared in many television shows in the 1970s, including an episode of The Brady Bunch called \"The Personality Kid\", alongside Christopher Knight, who would later appear with her in the Bigfoot and Wildboy episode \"White Wolf\". In 2001, she appeared as Donna Skyhawk in an episode of Any Day Now. Yvonne Regalado, who played \"Cindy,\" is now Yvonne Regalado Martin and is an opera singer. (Wikipedia)"

    "description": "The series is set in New Gotham City, several years after it has been abandoned by Batman. In his absence, Oracle and the Huntress have taken over his war on crime. The two are joined by Dinah (after she assists them in defeating Larry Ketterlly, a version of the Scarecrow); Alfred Pennyworth, who serves Helena as she is heir to the Wayne estate; and Detective Jesse Reese, a police officer confronted with crimes and abilities he cannot explain. A central feature of the series is the concept of metahumans: Individuals born with powers that cannot be explained. No two metahumans have the same specific ability (or set of abilities) and there exists a whole subculture of metahuman society that the outside world knows nothing about. It is into this world that Detective Reese is drawn, reluctantly teaming up with Huntress and the Birds of Prey to defeat metahuman criminals. At first, he is disapproving of Helena's vigilantism, even trying to arrest her, but eventually he realizes there is a need for the Birds of Prey to take down criminals the police can't handle. During the course of the show, the Birds of Prey often find themselves confronted with schemes masterminded by Dr. Quinzel, though they are unaware of her involvement until the final episode of the series. Quinzel's attempts to discover what Helena is hiding - and the duplicitous nature of their therapy sessions together - form a large part of the series arc, beginning in the pilot episode and being resolved in the series finale."

Help comes in the lumpy shape of Manny Bianco, a hairy, bumbling individual who (almost by osmosis) becomes Bernard's assistant. Manny is not exactly great at the job either but he is a million times better than Bernard. Next door is Fran, an anxious, frustrated woman who runs a sort of new-age shop selling the most unlikely bits of arty junk. Fran is friends with Bernard and, through him, with Manny; together the trio become embroiled in escapades that are sometimes extreme or violent or fantastically ludicrous, and always bizarre."

From the writer and executive producer of \"The Karate Kid\" and \"Kiss of the Dragon\",… More and the executive producers of Smallville, The WB's \"Black Sash\" features a multigenerational cast, dazzling martial arts and stories of hope and redemption. As an undercover narcotics cop, Tom Chang (Wong) paid a high price for staying true to his values. Framed and wrongly incarcerated in Hong Kong for allegedly smuggling heroin, he loses his career, his wife and the right to see his daughter. All he has left are the blazing skills of a master martial arts combatant. Now, after five years in a Hong Kong prison, Tom has come home to San Francisco, intent on restoring his life. Once back in San Francisco, Tom's mentor, Master Li (Mako, Pearl Harbor), gives Tom his martial arts school to run and a place to live in his building on the wharf. Tom finds a new family in the young men and women he trains in Chinese martial arts. His dedicated students include Tory Stratton (Missy Peregrym, Dark Angel, The Chris Isaak Show), a fiercely beautiful 17-year-old who has turned to martial arts as a way of dealing with the rage she feels over the death of her policeman father. A newcomer to the group, Trip Brady (Corey Sevier, Little Men ) is the victim of a violent father. For Trip, Tom's knowledge and kindness open the door to a new life. Bryan Lanier (Ray J, Moesha) is a tough-talking, streetwise teenager with a quick wit and a deep loyalty to his fellow students and to Tom. Another newcomer is the shy and warm-hearted Allie Bennett (Sarah Carter, Undeclared), who is searching for acceptance, friendship and for some of the skill and bravery she admires in Tory. Tom relies on the spiritual guidance of Master Li to help him deal with issues that arise in his life and the lives of his students. He also begins the long journey of trying to win back the right to see his daughter and the acceptance of his ex-wife, Beth (Ona Grauer). Tom spends his days teaching a new generation the skills and enlightenment he learned from Master Li. His message is timeless: patience and flexibility are the keys to overcoming any obstacle. Black Sash is produced by Tollin/Robbins Productions and Warner Bros. Television, with executive producers Carlton Cuse (Martial Law, Nash Bridges), Robert Kamen (The Karate Kid, Kiss of the Dragon), Dylan Sellers (The Replacements), Mike Tollin, Brian Robbins and Joe Davola (Smallville) From TheWB.com. Note #1: The series is filmed in Vancouver, Canada. Note #2: The show was originally titled The Bounty Hunter. Less"

    "description": "Set in 1929 in the fictional Blandings Castle, Timothy Spall plays the amiable but permanently distracted Lord Emsworth - known to his friends as Clarence - in what should be a cracking new adaptation of some much-loved tales by PG Wodehouse. The series is bound to win a whole new and well-deserved audience for Wodehouse, the great comic writer whose dates were 1881-1975. He has a host of fans, not least among them, writers and actors like Stephen Fry and Simon Callow, and indeed our own Marian Keyes. Marian declares him to be \"the ultimate in comfort reading, because nothing bad ever happens in PG Wodehouse's land.\" In the Blandings series, Emsworth struggles to keep his dysfunctional family in order but usually confuses things himself. All he wants is to be left in peace with his beloved pig The Empress, but friends, visitors, servants and spongers get in the way. Jennifer Saunders stars as his indomitable sister Connie, Jack Farthing as hapless son Freddy and Mark Williams as long-suffering butler Beach. There are guest appearances from David Walliams, Paloma Faith and David Bamber. The show was filmed at 400-year-old Crom Castle, near Newtownbutler in Northern Ireland, home of Lord Erne. There have been some spiffing PG Wodehouse series in the past, yet his achingly funny Blandings stories have been mostly overlooked. This high-spirited adaptation see Timothy Spall as fuddle-headed pig-fancier Lord Emsworth and Jennifer Saunders as his terrifying sister Lady Constance. Plum purists may snort at liberties taken with the opener Pig-Hoo-o-o-o-ey! but its tale of a porcine hunger-strike and frustrated young love is Wodehouse to a T."

The TV adaptation, written by the award-winning Andrew Davies, comprises a one-hour opening episode followed by 14 half-hour episodes. It will be shown twice weekly, using the pace, multiple storylines and cliff-hanger endings more usually associated with popular drama. The aim is to return Dickens to the broad audience he originally wrote for.It tells the story of the icily beautiful Lady Dedlock (Gillian Anderson), who nurses a dark secret in her past, and the merciless lawyer Tulkinghorn (Charles Dance), who seeks to uncover it.Then there's the generous John Jarndyce (Denis Lawson), struggling with his own past, and his two attractive young wards Richard (Patrick Kennedy) and Ada (Carey Mulligan). Like Lady Dedlock, they're all caught up in the infamous case of Jarndyce vs Jarndyce, which will make one of them rich beyond imagination - if it can ever be brought to a conclusion.And there's Esther Summerson (Anna Maxwell Martin), a girl without a past, whom Jarndyce takes under his wing as a companion for Ada, but with whom he falls in love, and whose connection with Lady Dedlock may bring ruin to them both.The cast of characters also contains some of Dickens' most famous creations - Smallweed (Phil Davis), the gleefully malignant moneylender; Miss Flite (Pauline Collins) with her tragic/comic mix of eccentricity and insight; the eccentric, and often drunk Krook (Johnny Vegas); Nemo (John Lynch), the mysterious law writer; Guppy (Burn Gorman), the ambitious young clerk, infatuated with Esther; Bucket (Alun Armstrong) the coolly amoral police inspector, at the centre of fiction's first ever whodunit; and Jo the young crossing sweeper, whose story almost brought Victorian England to a standstill.A BBC Production in association with Deep Indigo, Bleak House is the third collaboration between Andrew Davies and producer Nigel Stafford-Clark, following the acclaimed Trollope adaptations The Way We Live Now and He Knew He Was Right. It's directed by Justin Chadwick (EastEnders and Spooks) and Susanna White (Teachers and Mr Harvey Lights A Candle). Filming took place in Hertfordshire, Bedfordshire and Kent between February and July 2005."

Nucky acts with historical characters in both his personal and political life, including mobsters, politicians, government agents, and the common folk who look up to him. The federal government also takes an interest in the bootlegging and other illegal activities in the area, sending agents to investigate possible mob connections but also looking at Nucky's lifestyle—expensive and lavish for a county political figure.

We see BOBBY'S WORLD through the eyes of 4-year-old BOBBY, the alter ego of comedian Howie Mandel. Bobby's two biggest character traits are his penchant for taking things literally and letting his imagination get the best of him. Bobby, a short, toddling instigator of mischief, goads his siblings into courses of action that produce hilarious and timeless results. WEBBLY, the stuffed spider. Essentially, a face with eight legs, Webbly's expressions are worth a thousand words.

In this original eight-hour series, the unforgettable stories of doctors, nurses and patients are adeptly woven to give each hour the pace and intensity of a drama. Whether it's the young resident in crisis doubting that she's good enough to become a Harvard-trained doctor, or the deployed soldier's pregnant wife praying for a miracle surgery to save her baby, Boston Med is sure to touch your heart. Filmed over four months at Massachusetts General, Brigham and Women's, and Children's Hospital Boston, this powerfully real series breaks new ground in the documentary landscape. Meet the charismatic Hollywood producer before either he or the filmmakers realize that, through a twist of fate, his face will be transplanted onto a Vietnam veteran badly scarred in an accident. The second face transplant performed in this country and the first anywhere to be so extensively filmed, this operation involved two dozen surgeons and up to a hundred additional doctors and nurses. It's a stunning example of both the high caliber medicine and the unprecedented and unique access captured by the filmmakers in Boston Med."

Best-selling author Brad Meltzer has been writing novels for more than a decade. He has studied and written about some of the most revered institutions and documents in human history, including the U.S. Supreme Court, the Presidency, the Secret Service, Wall Street and the Bible. Brad has assembled a team to investigate the countless clues and theories uncovered through his years of research, but unexplored until now. From the dollar bill to the first Presidential Codes, the hidden messages of the Statue of Liberty and the ciphers protecting the location of lost Confederate gold, the team uncovers the truth behind history's most provocative secrets."

    "description": "CBS attempted once again to bring the Bradys back. In 1990, Schwartz was asked to write three 2-hour movies related to the bunch, and this ultimately turned into a 2-hour movie with four 1-hour episodes to follow. Maureen McCormick (Marcia) did not return for this series. He role was recast with Leah Ayres. This show was placed in the Friday night 8 o'clock time-slot, which Schwartz believes was its doom. He felt that dealing with the adult Bradys and their 90'ish problems was too grown-up for the time-slot and that it may have fared better an hour later. Thus explains its quick cancellation.

Braquo follows a squad of Paris cops who exist in the blurred boundaries at the very edge of the law, often using violence and intimidation to get the job done. The lives of these officers change radically when their squad leader, falsely accused of corruption, commits suicide. Determined to clear his name they start an investigation of their own, only to find that the police department itself stands in their way. Driven by adrenaline and a thirst for justice, they must turn their backs on the laws they’re sworn to enforce if they are to uncover the truth. Facing constant danger from all sides - and with the two most likely outcomes being imprisonment or death – the stakes couldn’t be higher, but that merely serves to crank up the tension in this acclaimed series."

Now, the BBC have asked him to front a major new documentary where he presents his guide to The Life Of Rock from prehistoric man to the present day, in a spoof three-part chronology of some of the biggest moments in rock history. Thotch band members and former Stowe classmates Pat Quid, guitarist (Fast Show colleague Paul Whitehouse) and keyboard player Tony Pebble – pronounced Pebblé (Nigel Havers) - join Brian to reminisce about their heyday and beyond. Matt Lucas and Michael Kitchen also star as Brian’s legendary producer Ray Thomas, and his infamous manager John Farrow respectively, with the likes of Vic Reeves and Bob Mortimer, and David Baddiel popping up as talking heads. With guests from the world of music playing versions of themselves, including Jools Holland, Rick Wakeman, David Arnold and Roger Taylor, Brian (Day) takes rock lovers on a re-imagined history of the genre. The Life Of Rock With Brian Pern is made by BBC Comedy Productions for BBC Four. It is directed and produced by Rhys Thomas and the executive producer is Saurabh Kakkar."

    "description": "Oxygen takes viewers to the small, close-knit community of Bay Ridge, Brooklyn and surrounding neighborhoods including Coney Island, Brighton Beach and Bensonhurst in Oxygen’s newest docu-series “Brooklyn 11223″. The series provides a voyeuristic look into the lives of a group of twentysomething friends whose once rock-solid friendships have been torn apart by betrayal. Bay Ridge was made famous by the iconic film “Saturday Night Fever” thirty-five years ago. The film’s coming-of-age themes of longing for escape and rolling with a tough crowd remain very much the same today. Nothing is more important in these Brooklyn neighborhoods than loyalty, respect and family. This is the story of someone who may have broken that code during an evening clouded in mystery when one friend may have betrayed another by seducing a boyfriend. Vividly shot in a lush documentary style that showcases the urban streetscapes of Brooklyn, “Brooklyn 11223″ follows the story of childhood friends Joey Lynn and Christie and their respective group of friends as they spend their summer learning about themselves, the bonds of friendship and the price of betrayal."

MIKE TRAINOR (Strahan) seemingly has it all he's a good-looking, wealthy and recently retired NFL player living the high-life in New York City, but he's about to get sidelined. When Mike gets a phone call from his MOM (CCH Pounder, \"The Shield\") who orders him home to Houston, he quickly realizes the more his life has changed, the more his family has stayed the same. His brother CHILL (Daryl \"Chill\" Mitchell), whose life was altered drastically after a car accident left him in a wheelchair, is struggling to keep his restaurant afloat with the help of his loudmouth associate, ROSCOE (Colton Dunn, \"MADtv\"). The dynamics between Mike and Chill are the same as when they were kids, and their sibling rivalry hasn't lessened with age. If they can stop their bickering, put aside their differences and learn to be teammates, the brothers might just turn out to be each other's biggest asset. (CPFTFC) Wedged between Mike and Chill are their parents. Their father, whom everyone refers to as COACH (Carl Weathers, \"Rocky\"), is the local high school football coach and the conservative, opinionated alpha male of his clan. Coach thinks he runs the show, but really it's Mom who calls the shots. Saucy, stern and a schemer, she is the mastermind of the family. And when she learns that Mike's business manager took off with all his money, she orchestrates a plan to keep Mike in Houston, save Chill's restaurant and bring the family back together under one roof again all without anyone realizing what she's up to. Mom's plan helps Mike realize that his family however dysfunctional they may be is the only family he's got. And although he may not have a penny to his name, as long as he's surrounded by people who love him, he'll always be a rich man."

In 2491, Buck, who has survived due to the freezing, is revived and tries to adjust to life on 25th-century post-nuclear Earth.

The series began on the launch night of Channel 4 on 2 November 1982, and ran for 21 years until 4 November 2003. The series was produced by Mersey Television and it was conceived by Phil Redmond. Brookside became very successful for a number of years and is notable for its tackling of realistic and socially challenging storylines. It was at its most popular in the 1980s and the early 1990s. From the mid-1990s it began raising more controversial subjects under the guidance of new producers such as Mal Young and Paul Marquess. It is especially well-known for broadcasting the first pre-watershed lesbian kiss on British television, as well as a powerful domestic abuse storyline resulting in murder. The series caused an uproar when it featured a storyline featuring a consensual incestuous sexual relationship between two sibling characters during 1996. Brookside was also the first British soap to feature an openly gay character when (Gordon Collins) came out in 1985, and it was also the first to depict serious drug addiction with a number of different characters. Although the series had a long and successful run, by 2000 its viewing figures were in terminal decline and low ratings eventually led to its cancellation in July 2003. The final episode was broadcast on 4 November 2003 and was watched by around 2 million viewers."

    "description": "Each year, millions of Americans set out to renovate their property in hopes of finally achieving their dream home. Sadly, thousands of these unsuspecting homeowners instead become victims, duped and abandoned by the contractors they trusted their savings to and left with either unfinished or danger-laden, uninhabitable homes due to poor craftsmanship. Host and master carpenter Adam Carolla and his team, consisting of no-nonsense, expert contractor Skip Bedell and his wife, private investigator Alison Bedell, are on a mission to track down these shady, evasive contractors and drag them back to the scene of the crime to face the music and fix the disasters they left behind. Eleven half-hour episodes of \"Catch A Contractor\" debut starting Sunday, March 9 at 10PM ET/PT with two back-to-back new episodes on Spike TV. Home improvement scams have consistently ranked in the Better Business Bureau's top 10 consumer cons. Carolla, who spent 10 years working in construction before his successful career in radio and television, takes this issue very personally. As a passionate master carpenter who has built hundreds of homes including his own, he not only has a keen eye when it comes to identifying shoddy, inferior work, but loathes seeing trusting and naïve average citizens getting scammed by subpar contractors and left holding the proverbial bag."

As tradition goes, the next step for the couple is obvious, but on this road to the altar, all is not as it seems. VH1's new docu-series \"Chrissy & Mr. Jones\" is a look inside one of Hip Hop's most infamous couples. As they weave through their own development, they'll collide with their past, embark on new ventures and make the difficult decision about tying the knot. This is a story about commitment, drama, industry and at the end of the day -- family. After 8 years of courtship Chrissy Lampkin finally has a ring on her finger from rapper Jim Jones -- and a seriously big one at that. Most would think she'd be making a mad dash to the altar but on the contrary, Chrissy's her own woman. Chrissy is battling with her desire for independence. She's bored with being seen as Jim's girl and is looking for her own emancipation. Despite her diamond engagement ring, her fiancé is still a rapper who doesn't want to grow up. She's grown tired of his antics and believes she can re-establish her position in the relationship by stepping away from Jim's credit line. Furthermore, Chrissy is in her early 40s and she thinks about whether she should try and have a baby... All to be figured out before Ms. Lampkin becomes Mrs. Jones. Jim Jones of the legendary DipSet is a rapper known around the world. And many believe his career is ready to be taken to a new level. It's been years since his last chart topper and his volatile nature is no secret in the industry. Jim and his fiancé disagree on his path back to success. He thinks he can do it alone and she thinks he needs a partner who can help guide him. Nancy \"Momma\" Jones is still up to her old tricks and has more up her sleeve. Ever hustling, she's looking to launch her own perfume, clothing line and liquor. Mimicking her son's fame she now wants her own reality show. Only a year after breaking into the 'granny rap' scene, Nancy's relationship with her long-standing friend and music producer Freddie Robinson is on the rocks. Momma has begun cutting him out of deals and he's geared up to ask. \"Where's my money!?\" At the moment her rocky relationship with her future daughter-in-law Chrissy is at a serene place but drama lurks around the corner. Nancy is still harboring resentment for Chrissy not giving her a grandchild and is using this energy to nitpick her gripes with the newly engaged. Stylist Emily Bustamante is still Chrissy's main confidante and is the biggest supporter of Jim and Chrissy tying the knot. Chrissy's engagement represents everything Emily ever wanted from her own rapper boyfriend and baby daddy Fabolous. She's given up her stance on independence and has moved back in to Fab's house. This year, she is attempting to refocus her energy towards her own career. Talia Coles, fashion stylist to the hip hop stars, has recently joined forces with team Chrissy. Her main gig is styling and designing original jackets for Trey Songz. She and Chrissy bond over their love of bling and fashion and aspire to one day go into business together. In this 8 episode series, Jim & Chrissy will attempt to find their way. How does the image of a stable family rack up alongside the unpredictable world of the music industry. Chrissy steers through the waters of commitment, disappointment and career. Jim will learn from his past and push forward, or sink as his own worst enemy ... on Chrissy & Mr. Jones."

In each of the six hour-long episodes, Elyse will create a strategy that helps these collectors curate and showcase their collection by assessing where the true value lies and then allow them to decide what's worth keeping and what they can sell. These massive collections include dining rooms stuffed with 30,000 comic books, a garage filled to the rafters with Catwoman memorabilia, and an almost uninhabitable house filled with Transformers. For each collector, parting with some of their collection may free up some much needed space in their home, provide a cash windfall to get out of debt, or even just allow a couple to become more focused on their relationship."

He is a faded star from the golden days of variety, prone to delusions of grandeur, selective memory loss and the blurting out of malapropisms.

Believing that another great entertainment triumph is only a phone call away, Arthur spends his day making the most of any opportunity that comes along - gaining a free lunch or selling a dodgy foot-spa he doesn't want - creating chaos and confusion wherever he goes, blissfully unaware that he has done so. The series begins with the recent death of Max Barker - Count Arthur's old partner from the early days in variety. Max pushed Arthur aside and went on to be a 'national treasure'. Max's son is Michael. He is a quiet, scholarly type, rather stuck in a rut writing history books. Having been asked to write a biography of his famous father from the neglected son's point of view and sets off to find his father's old variety partner - Count Arthur Strong. Thinking that the 'research' will only take a couple of days, Michael arrives London, tracks down Arthur and very quickly enters the chaos that is Arthur's world..."

Coupling gives us insight on modern romance and its often humorous consequences. \"When a couple gets together, it's never just the two of them - they also bring baggage - and Susan and Steve are no exception. Their baggage is a crowd of best friends and exes who talk about all aspects of sex and relationships on their never-ending quest to find true love. \"Susan is a beautiful go-getter with an uninhibited attitude who used to date Patrick, the sextet's charismatic, cocky player, Chicago's king of conquests - a guy who's just too cool to worry about being smart. Attractive Sally is a beauty therapist who is Susan's unashamedly vain best friend, who aggressively battles aging with heavy doses of moisturizer and men - including Patrick. \"Meanwhile, Steve, while getting together with Susan, can't seem to shake loose from his vivacious and slightly vacuous ex-girlfriend Jane, a woman supremely confident in her ability to seduce anyone of either sex, and who refuses to be dumped unless she's the one doing the dumping. Jeff is Steve's \"porn buddy\" who is, in equal parts, obsessed and bewildered by actual sex; charming in his way, but with an uncanny ability to say the wrong thing at the worst possible time. He works in the same office as Susan, with whom he had a disastrous and unsuccessful one-night fling.\""

As the boys began to dig, they found a number of intriguing artifacts. It was the end of the piracy era and rumors of buried treasure were rampant. The boys’ discovery launched a treasure hunt that has spanned more than 200 years, cost millions of dollars and involved dozens of speculators, engineers and even famous personalities such as John Wayne, Errol Flynn and Franklin D. Roosevelt. The search had gone dormant, but now, Rick and Marty Lagina, two brothers from Michigan, have bought most of the island and have renewed the efforts to discover the legendary treasure. Since childhood, Oak Island has been a magical place of intrigue for these men. With Marty’s financial backing, Rick is now leading the adventure of his life. But will their luck be any different from the many explorers who sought treasure before them and failed? The Laginas insist that their goal is the fun of a treasure-hunting adventure, and if it becomes something that could splinter their brotherly bond, they’ll walk away. But obsession has been known to grip treasure seekers on Oak Island. Many men have taken on the hunt with the best of intentions, only to be left with decimated fortunes, broken spirits and lost lives. An ominous legend says that seven people must die in pursuit of the treasure before Oak Island will reveal her secrets. So far, the body count stands at six."

Christmas has never been so spicy. Dead Ringers started life on BBC Radio Four. Listeners loved the witty way it lampooned the station's shows and personalities: newsreaders Brian Perkins and Charlotte Green were transformed into \"The Daddy\", and a sultry sex-kitten, respectively! When the show made the leap to TV, a host of new targets walked into the line of fire including Ricky Gervais, Ozzy Osbourne, Fiona Bruce, Dirty Den and Kirsty Allsop (from Location Location Location). All of these characters (and more) are brought to you by a cast of just four regulars (Kevin Connelly, Jon Culshaw, Mark Perry and Jan Ravens).

Then there's club vice-president Billy the Kid, who waits in the wings wondering if he'll have the chance to lead the Laffing Devils. And younger member Snubz breaks all the biker stereotypes with his degree in finance and a full-time corporate job.

The Laffing Devils' unofficial headquarters is the auto body shop owned by fellow member Hawkster, but police pressure might force the club to find a new home. Moving is going to cost the club money, so Gipsy seeks out security work for the Laffing Devils guarding a liquor store in a very dangerous part of town.

Get ready to be part of the action when a documentary crew rolls with some of Detroit's finest, offering an insider's glimpse behind the curtain of a Homicide Unit. The cameras unearth the crisis and revelation, heartbreak and heroism of these inner city cops—moments of raw exposure when they address us directly, as well as private moments when they forget they're being filmed. There's the damaged but driven Detective Louis Fitch, a wily homicide vet who is the most respected—and most misunderstood—man in the division; Detective Damon Washington, Fitch's new partner, who finds the first day on the job is a trial by fire, complicated by the imminent birth of his first child; Detective Ariana Sanchez, sexy, edgy and beautiful, who has emerged from a rough background to become a rising star in the department; Narcotics undercover cop John Stone, a streetwise smooth talker, clever and quick with a smile made for the movies, who is teamed with Sanchez—a combustible pairing rife with conflict and sexual tension; Sergeant Jesse Longford, a 30-year veteran struggling with his impending retirement from the force and the city he loves, who, together with his partner, Detective Aman Mahajan—a fully Americanized son of Indian immigrants—form an amusing mismatch of experience and enthusiasm, intellect and instinct, old school and new world, but whose combined skills have never encountered a case that couldn't be cleared; and all are headed by Lieutenant Maureen Mason, a strong-willed single mom struggling to balance home and work. The men and women of Detroit Homicide are as smart and tough as they come. They have to be, working the neighborhoods of the once and future Motor City, a rebounding bastion of middle America still saddled with the highest murder rate in the country. Detroit 1-8-7 stars Michael Imperioli (The Sopranos) as Detective Louis Fitch, Jon Michael Hill as Detective Damon Washington, James McDaniel (NYPD Blue) as Sergeant Jesse Longford, Aisha Hinds (True Blood) as Lieutenant Maureen Mason, Natalie Martinez as Detective Ariana Sanchez, D.J.

You wonder, though, how can small, individual measures like switching to CFLs and using canvas grocery bags in lieu of plastic be enough to save the planet? Tune in to Discovery Project Earth and watch as some of the world's leading scientists put the most ambitious geo-engineering ideas to the test in order to tackle global climate change. From covering acres of Greenland's glaciers in protective blankets to stop the ice from melting, to constructing rockets to send tiny reflective lenses into orbit, to planting thousands of saplings via a mass aerial drop to reforest barren areas — these are experiments on an epic scale. Each one will push the boundaries of science and technology, but will they produce groundbreaking environmental results? Working with the uncompromising visionaries whose large-scale experiments will be featured on the program is the Discovery Project Earth task force. Members of the task force include Jennifer Languell, an eco-house-building engineer for whom no task is too daunting; Basil Singer, a scientific boy wonder who, at 29, has a doctorate in astrophysics and builds robots for a living; and finally, Kevin O'Leary, a billionaire entrepreneur and venture capitalist who can fund the impossible. See what happens when \"what if?\" meets \"why not?\" Discovery Project Earth re-engineers the planet's possibilities and literally spans the globe, pinpointing areas of both concern and opportunity in confronting climate change."

What Beavis & Butthead were to the music video generation, DJ & The Fro are to the YouTube generation. They find the best web videos and make jokes about them so you don't have to. When they're not watching videos, DJ & Fro kill time by doing things like blackmailing pedophiles into doing their work for them, drinking the breast milk of a co-worker, stalking alpacas and sexually harassing one another. Work at Oppercon Industries is a mere distraction from their true passion: being idiots. Friends since college, DJ & Fro are virtually inseparable. Fro is the big haired Batman to DJ's Batgirl -- the brash ringleader of their two-man circus. He's got the self-confidence of someone much cooler and smarter than he is, but will very occasionally offer a shockingly insightful comment on one of the bizarre video clips they relish finding online. DJ is as insecure as Fro is cocky --- he's perfectly happy to languish in Fro's shadow and does everything possible to avoid conflict. A non-practicing Jew, DJ has a dark family history that peeks out once in a while, much to the delight of the Fro. Of the two of them, DJ's probably a little smarter, but that's not saying a lot. Never in the history of television has there been a show that combines animated storytelling and found video so expertly. DJ & The Fro are the perfect anti-heroes for today's web-addled mouse potatoes, and not since Dallas has a show spoken so perfectly for an entire generation. (read less)"

In one episode, Eliot even enters Dog City himself to join Ace in solving a mystery.

The bulldog crime-boss Bugsy Vile was inspired by the building's grouchy bulldog superintendent Bruno.

Along the way, they'll have the chance to win one million dollars and a slew of some incredible prizes, such as a pair of jet skis, a grand piano, a trip to Paris, or a brand new car. In the six episode, one-hour weekly series, the addictive, action-packed Downfall will be played atop the roof of a Downtown Los Angeles high-rise, where contestants will try to quickly answer a series of trivia questions against the clock in seven rounds. Fabricated facsimiles of all prizes will be placed on the largest conveyor belt ever seen on TV with a pile of cash at the end ranging from $5,000 to $1 million. In each round, players will try to answer all the questions before their prizes and cash go over the edge, off the roof, and sent crashing 100 feet to the street below. If the cash goes over the side of the building, then the game is over and that player is eliminated. If a player begins to struggle for answers to the game's category-based questions, there will be two ways to back up the belt: Surrender A Personal Possession, where the player offers a prized possession of their own onto the conveyor belt at the risk of it being dropped over the edge and destroyed; or the Friend On The Belt option, where a player's own friend or family member—even their Grandmother—can be placed on the belt to help them find the answers. If they don't beat the clock, this person takes the chance of going off the side of the building just like the previous prizes—in this case, wearing a decelerator harness to soften the fall. After each successful round, the player can leave with prizes won or risk them all to keep going toward the million dollar final prize. In the last round, the player will stand on the conveyor belt holding all the cash, heading towards the edge of the building.

Dresden is a haunted man (in more ways than one) who has sinned and been sinned against. But in the darkness of his past, he finds an inner strength and a driving desire to set things right. Armed with his trusty staff (okay, it's a hockey stick) and winning personality (if you don't mind the snarky sense of humor), and aided and abetted by his annoying spiritual advisor, Bob (doomed soul, expert in magic, noodge), Dresden champions the underdog against all manner of supernatural threats -- for five hundred dollars a day. Plus expenses. Dresden doesn't do parties and he doesn't do love potions. But if the hocus starts to pocus, if the going gets... strange, if the things that go bump in the night start packing a punch, call him. He's in the book. Based on the best-selling novels by Jim Butcher, The Dresden Files has been described as being a lot like Harry Potter... if Harry Potter had been written by the illegitimate love child of Raymond Chandler and Douglas Adams."

The term \"super obese\" defines those who exceed their estimated ideal weight by approximately 225 percent and who are roughly 200 pounds or more overweight. Trainer and transformation specialist Chris Powell (\"The 640-Pound Virgin\") will guide each of eight participants through their transformation process by moving into their homes with their families or loved ones. By assuring that they have the proper nourishment and exercise movement, Chris will provide a fresh perspective to individuals whose lives have become unmanageable because of their weight. In each of the eight one-hour episodes, the participants undergo a transformation not only of their bodies, but of who they are as individuals. Each stand-alone episode of the series will chronicle one participant's journey to reclaim his or her life."

This time around, the character of Mr. Roarke was taken over by character actor Malcolm McDowell. Sinister yet somehow charming, Mr. Roarke hung up his white tuxes in the pilot to don a more stylish black suit, which was foreshadowing of the change in the character. His powers, which would often defy nature, were taken to the ultimate extreme as he summoned lightening and storms, terrorized his prisoners (and sometimes guests), and even changed the gender of one man. Meeting the guests at the dock with Mr. Roarke were Cal (Louis Lombardi), the chubby brainless bellhop, and Harry (Edward Hibbert), the debonaire Englishman concierge. Cal and Harry were reduced to being Roarke's prisoners, using their time on the island to work off a debt to Roarke. Also working as Roarke's assistant was Ariel (Madchen Amick), a beautiful shape"

Bravely willing to lampoon the image that has been mercilessly ridiculed over the past few years, Alley will give us a glimpse of the humor and the irony in her battle to lose weight and get back on television in a tough business that prefers the svelt figures seen on the most successful actresses of today. This irreverant new series is generally unscripted, with each episode emanating from a story outline and the actors largely improvising the dialogue.

Barth returned to his home of Fernwood to start this new talk show on Channel 6. Immediately, he used it as a platform to deny the charges made against him in the Fernwood Courier (\"There has never been a conviction\").

They portrayed a divorced couple who still worked together hosting a travel show called \"Ticket to Ride\". It was shot on location in Europe in such places as Ireland, Malta, and Budapest. Part of the fun was each week brought them to a new location - and a new adventure, usually unwittingly involving Louisa, a magnet for trouble. Michael often had to come to her rescue, sometimes getting hurt (usually in the head) in the process. The other part of the fun was realizing that just maybe they were still in love with each other. Based on the screwball comedies of the '40s, it often lifted lines directly from the old movies. This show only aired 7 weeks in the U.S. before being cancelled due to poor ratings, but it was aired in Europe for the entire run of the episodes, 13 in all."

Whereas \"Dallas\" was set in Texas, \"Flamingo Road\" was also set in the South in the fictional- yet well-to-do- community of Truro County, Florida. The town was run by the corrupt and powerful sheriff, Titus Semple, who made it his point to know everyone's business.

A flashy team of Football Wives will give viewers a never-before-seen look into the glamorous, and dramatic, life of a professional football player's spouse in VH1's original series. VH1's Football Wives include: * Pilar Sanders, married to Deion Sanders, all-pro cornerback, retired * Amanda Davis married to Leonard Davis, guard, Dallas * Chanita Foster, wife of Offensive Lineman George Foster, 7-year veteran with Denver, Cleveland, Detroit * Brittany Pigrenet, girlfriend of David Buehler, kicker, Dallas * Dawn Neufeld, wife of Tight End Ryan Neufeld, 7-year veteran with Dallas, Jacksonville, Buffalo * Melani Ismail, married to Rocket Ismail, receiver, retired * Erin McBriar, married to Mat McBriar, punter, Dallas * Mercedes Nelson, ex-girlfriend of star Dallas football player Set in the cradle of American football, Dallas, this series goes inside the real-life locker room of the spouses of some of the biggest footballers in the game. Many of these ladies live the life. They drive the best cars, live in the biggest mansions, wear designer clothes and jewelry, and travel first class. But living the high life is not all glamour and is frequently fleeting. Football players are often injured so their partners are forced to not only play wife, but also be a mother or nurse to their man. The careers of these modern-day gladiators span only a few years on average and their life-expectancy is alarmingly low. There is often a fine line between the stars who collect big contracts and the journeymen who fight to stay in the league, sometimes struggling to pay their bills. And unlike basketball players, football stars travel less for games and are more often home with their families. What price will they pay for enduring the equivalent of multiple head-on collisions on any given Sunday?"

These single men and women are ready to trade in their cell phones for suntan lotion and business suits for bathing suits, in order to bask in the sun and soak up the fun -- and the longer they stay, the more money they can earn. Each week they remain in Eden, contestants will accrue more earnings, but the only way to keep their winnings is to remain in paradise, which has a price. They need to avoid eviction and their desire to return to civilization. Meanwhile, surprises and twists are around every corner. Secrets may be revealed and former flames and in-laws may show up unannounced, making waves in what they thought would be peaceful waters. Additionally, from time to time, some residents forced out and replaced by new contestants armed with knowledge gleaned from having viewed the series at home. And although the residents will be earning money throughout their stay, those who throw in the towel and leave on their own volition could go with empty pockets. If they can handle the unexpected, avoid being evicted and live without their friends and families back home, these contestants could potentially spend months or years as residents of Eden, forming relationships and creating their own storylines to ensure that they remain on-air as docu-soap stars and live the life of luxury they crave. Will they stay forever in Eden?"

The Forsyte Saga so captured the imagination of end of the decade TV viewers that it inspired what is today known as the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) to create a series called Masterpiece Theater. Originally broadcast in the United Kingdom in 1967, the Forsyte Saga crossed the \"pond\" in 1969, airing on Sunday nights. It not only inaugurated the arrival of the British drama to the US but also the dramatic form of the mini-series. Although sharing some qualities with the soap opera format, The Forsyte Saga had a beginning and an end and was never intended for more than one season. The story, roughly, is that of a large family in Victorian England. We see three generations of Forsytes struggle with love, money, and family secrets that will hang over them. The series can be safely divided into two sections thematically."

Some of them have been affected in mysterious ways, and some will have certain abilities, both good and bad, so part of the drama will be watching them adjust to these changes within themselves. The series kicks off with a ball of light sailing toward Earth, but rather than the expected catastrophic event, thousands of returned abductees are left with no memory of their otherworldly experiences. Each has been gone anywhere from a few months to several decades but none has aged a day."

The jury considered this to be not an act of heroism but of murder and sent him to prison for life. After 20 years as a model prisoner, Gabriel came in contact with an aggressive attorney named Victoria, who was fascinated by his case and the many irregularities in his trial. Convinced he was innocent, she got him released but Gabriel found that life outside could be even tougher for an ex-con, especially since many on the police force still hated and distrusted him.

Nicholas unknowingly activates the egg and sends himself and Allegra into the Outer Dimension, where they find themselves as part of an intrepid group attempting to save Galidor, which is being targeted by the sinister Gorm. The kingdom of Galidor is protected by an immense door that could only open by an egg-shaped key, which was split in pieces across the Outer Dimension to prevent Gorm from entering Galidor.

In the gritty new action-drama GANG RELATED, Detective RYAN LOPEZ (Ramon Rodriguez, “Battle Los Angeles,” “The Wire”) is a rising star in Los Angeles' elite Gang Task Force. What the world doesn't know is that long before Ryan became a cop, he pledged allegiance to a different band of brothers – a powerful Latino gang called Los Angelicos. When Ryan's best friend and police partner is senselessly killed by a notorious gang member, Ryan teams up with longtime Task Force member CASSIUS GREEN (RZA, “G.I. Joe: Retaliation,” “Californication”), who has been at the forefront of the city's war on organized crime. In this war between law enforcement and gangs, the series explores how only people who really know the streets can win the battle on the streets. Despite his profession, Ryan is still beholden to the gang's leader, JAVIER ACOSTA (Cliff Curtis, “Live Free or Die Hard,” “Training Day”), the father figure Ryan has tried to make proud his entire life and the man who masterminded his entry into the police force. It's a secret that has been held for a decade by Ryan, Javier and Javier's sons: cold-blooded gang lieutenant CARLOS (Rey Gallegos, “Sons of Anarchy,” “24”); and Ryan's childhood best friend, straight-laced investment banker DANIEL (Jay Hernandez, “Last Resort,” “Hostel”). But Ryan is starting to realize that he is even more dedicated to being a cop than he is to Los Angelicos. He is respected by his team, including TAE KIM (Sung Kang, “Fast Five,” “Live Free or Die Hard”), VERONICA “VEE” DOTSEN (Inbar Lavi, “Underemployed,” “Street Kings 2: Motor City”) and Task Force leader SAM CHAPEL (Terry O'Quinn, “Lost”), Ryan's other surrogate father figure, whose estranged daughter, JESSICA (Shantel VanSanten, “One Tree Hill,” “The Final Destination”), is the city's Assistant District Attorney. Ryan's education comes from the streets, and that schooling will work to his advantage, as he, Cassius and the rest of the police unit take aim at the city's most dangerous gangs. While balancing two allegiances, two father figures and two families, Ryan's increasing sense of loyalty to one will help him finally determine which side of the law he is really on."

They usually start out as a form of protection for their members and the community but then, grow predatory as they feed on the very people that they purport to defend.

While on a diving assignment, Sam was affected by the radiation from an underwater explosion. The radiation rendered him invisible, but INTERSECT devised a way to control his invisibility, by fitting him with a computerized watch that kept him visible. He could, however, shut it off, and become invisible again, for short periods of time. If he did this for more than 15 minutes in any 24 hour period he would die. This ability to become invisible made him a very effective agent."

These nanites randomly activate inside their hosts, mutating the subject into a monster known as an E.V.O. (Exponentially Variegated Organism). These Evos are usually mindless creatures that are a danger to everything around them. To combat the Evo threat, the organization known as Providence was created to capture and cure them. Rex is a 15-year-old amnesiac teenager who, like everyone else, has been infected with nanites. However, unlike most Evos, Rex can control his nanites, allowing him to manifest a variety of powers and even cure other Evos of their mutations. Working with Providence under Agent Six, he helps stop the Evos as they appear. Working against Providence is Van Kleiss, an Evo with connections that are not only to the event which released the nanites, but to Rex as well."

As he was age 89 when the show premiered, George Burns was billed as the oldest person ever to \"star\" in a television series. Burns had been around television in one way or another since shortly after its inception; like many old-time radio stars he had brought his routine over more-or-less intact from the older medium. However, his actual role in this series was rather slight; aside from lending his name, introducing the night's program, and providing an occasional voice-over narration."

He can turn a courtroom into a circus if that's what it takes to win a case. This was very effective when he worked out of an office above a fruit stand in a working-class neighborhood. But now he's a partner in a posh, upscale law firm, and his irreverent style often conflicts with his wealthy co-workers and the stately senior partner, Jason DeWitt. Yet, with the help of his allies--his eccentric mother Pearl and his lovely and cunning private investigator Frankie, Lou proves that nobody is beyond the reach of the law or above needing the talents of The Great Defender.\" (WB promo)"

Now, even Ben has to admit that it's time to resume a social life. As he eases back into dating, he finds he has as much to relearn about women as Matty is learning for the first time. Contributing plenty of advice are Ben's brother, Carl, and his dad, James, as well as his publishing house co-worker Alex, Alex's ex-wife, Nicole, and their assistant, Angela. This process proves even more awkward than necessary, since the modest Ben, with his offbeat wit, has no idea how attractive he is to women. For Ben and Matty, who have never had trouble talking openly about anything, now even the simplest conversation has become complicated - especially when the topic is the women in their lives.\" (CBS press release)"

Each episode of the series stands alone and has its own cast. All achieve a high standard of psychological tension, in the best traditions of British horror. Look out for British stars of the later 1980s appearing in some of their earliest on-screen roles, including Simon MacCorkindale, Rosalyn Landor, Caroline Langrishe, and Pierce Brosnan."

That is until Hank is forced out of his CEO job and has to move his family back home to the small town of River Bend. A self-made man, Hank is used to running the show, but now that he's lost almost everything, can he learn how to hang with his family? The Pryors have had to seriously downsize their lives even their king-sized bed won't fit in their modest new home. Tilly's not too pleased to be back in the same zip code as her family especially her badgering brother Grady. Hank's offbeat son Henry worries about fitting in with a new crowd and his daughter Maddie would rather talk on her cell phone than be anywhere near her Dad. But every great businessman knows that the key to success is to turn setbacks into opportunities. Hank has big plans to get ahead in business... and to reconnect with his family. It may take a while for an industrial giant to figure out how to mingle with the little people like his family but Hank's up for the challenge. Like that smaller bed... Turns out that wasn't such a bad idea after all."

Instead, Marti's scholarship gets cancelled and her mother \"forgets\" to tell her. Out of options, Marti finds herself fighting for a spot on the Hellcats -- Lancer's legendary cheer squad -- and for the scholarship that comes with it. The squad needs a new member when the beautiful Alice Verdura is injured, and Marti's fierce style, soulful moves and gymnastic elegance win her a place on the team, despite an ugly encounter with Savannah Monroe, a petite and peppy Texan who ends up being Marti's new roommate. Marti instantly hits it off with her new squad partner, the charming and extremely athletic Lewis Flynn, and their budding friendship causes alarm bells to go off for Lewis' ex, Alice, as well as Marti's long-time friend, Dan Patch. Overseeing all the practices and personal drama is former Hellcats star and current coach Vanessa Lodge, whose job is on the line unless the squad wins the upcoming nationals. Just like Marti, Vanessa's future is riding on the Hellcats ascending to the very top of the fiercely competitive world of college cheerleading."

The Los Angeles Devils are the #1 team in the league. When the arena lights go on, all of Hollywood comes out to support the million dollar players. But in this city these men share the fame, adrenalin, money, sex and power with their dancers, the Devil Girls. At the heart of the series is Ahsha, a sheltered young woman who joins the team against the wishes of her mother Sloane, who knows this treacherous, tempting world all too well having been a Devil Girl herself. Olivia is the shrewd squad manager, Jelena is the ruthless, star captain who won't let anyone else share the spotlight and Pete Davenport is the former All-Star who's come back to coach his old team."

    "description": "Hogs Gone Wild is a new adrenaline-packed series taking viewers to the front lines in the war against an increasingly destructive and invasive enemy: the feral hog. Expert trappers track and fight these aggressive and dangerous boars as they attack homes, farms and urban backyards. Each episode documents the perilous challenges and dangerous battles of hog removal experts. The feral hog epidemic now extends into 44 states. Left unchecked, it could become one of America's greatest environmental catastrophes. Wild hogs are an invasive species that not only threaten homes, farmland, forest and native wildlife, they also present a physical threat to humans, and can spread deadly disease. With no natural predators, wild boars and sows are notoriously aggressive. Often they will charge and attack a person rather than run. The tusks of a boar extend 2 to 4 inches outside of its mouth, are self-honing to a razor sharpness, and are swung like swords. An encounter with a wild boar can leave a victim bleeding to death or infected with a lethal disease. So our featured trappers need to be as cautious as they are crafty. As one of our team members says, \"These aren't little pen piglets we're dealing with. They're big, dangerous and deadly hogs.\" With the help of highly-skilled dogs, infrared night vision, state-of-the-art trapping devices and a know-no-fear attitude, these trappers will stop at nothing to find and catch even the deadliest of Hogs Gone Wild."

And once word gets around, guests stop coming around. That's when Anthony Melchiorri arrives on the scene. He's a hotel ``fixer,'' the guy hotel operators call when their establishment needs to be overhauled. This hourlong series portrays the tough-love style Melchiorri uses at hotels across the country as he implements changes that include staff retraining and lobby renovations. With more than 20 years of experience in the hospitality business, Melchiorri says he knows the minute he walks into a hotel what needs to be fixed."

Adding to the chaos is a constant stream of unwelcome visitors to Vic and Bob’s flat. Amongst them is Beef a lady-obsessed lothario, not to be confused with Bosh, a Geordie ex-con, who has designs on moving in as well."

We were meant to find them charmingly irresponsible and free-spirited. We did not. In contrast to the similarly themed triangle comedy Two Guys, a Girl and a Pizza Place, this made delayed adolescence seem, well, childish. \"The unique friendship shared by a trio of childhood chums and roommates from Denver is the focus of this half-hour comedy. Through romances, job problems and the trials and tribulations of daily life, a woman and her two male roommates give modern romance a decidedly comic spin. \"'House Rules is about two men and a woman in their mid-twenties who, after 20 years of growing up together, going"

When Andrew's editor, Jerry (Dave Foley), tells him to put a modern, sexy twist on his column or be fired, he hires Bert as a life coach in the hopes of learning to be less \"gentle man\" and more \"real man.\" Andrew's mom, Diane (Nancy Lenehan), and his bossy sister, Janet (Mary Lynn Rajskub), support the plan, as would Janet's husband, Mike (Rhys Darby), if he was allowed to have an opinion. Though Andrew and Bert's views may be centuries apart, they may find they're each other's missing link."

    "description": "There's a lot of information in How the Earth Was Made, but perhaps the most interesting relates to time. Quite often, the numbers are so staggering that scientists refer to it as \"deep time,\" an appropriate term when one grapples with the notion that our planet is 4.5 billion years old, or that the oceans were formed by rainfall that lasted literally millions of years, or that 700 million years ago, Earth was completely covered by ice that was a mile thick, with surface temperatures reaching minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit. On the other end of the scale are numbers that seem surprisingly small: for instance, it wasn't until 220 years ago that the accepted church doctrine regarding the planet's age (no more than 6000 years, according to the Bible) was seriously challenged and that the key to its past was found in rocks, not scripture, while the discovery that dinosaurs once ruled the Earth came considerably later than that. Using a combination of computer graphics and animation, various drawings and diagrams, photos, location footage, and expert commentary, this fascinating, 94-minute History Channel production takes us from the very beginning, when the planet was formed by meteors colliding in space, through numerous major events (including the appearance of water, granite, and oxygen) and mind-boggling catastrophes (such as mass extinctions caused by volcanic eruptions or the enormous meteor that wiped out 75% of all living things, including the dinosaurs, some 65 million years ago), right up to the present; there's even a glimpse into the future, when Earth will likely end up as barren and lifeless as Mars (no need to hit the panic button yet, though--a few billion more years will pass before that happens). Bonus features include additional scenes and a documentary entitled \"Inside the Volcano.\" --Sam Graham"

Ted's new quest in life was much to the dismay of his womanizing friend, Barney Stinson. But soon after Marshall and Lily's engagement, Ted believed that his life mate was going to be news reporter and aspiring news anchor Robin Scherbatsky, who, despite having had a romantic relationship with her after this time, ended up being who the kids know as their \"Aunt\" Robin. As Ted relays the story to his kids, the constants are that their Uncle Marshall, Aunt Lily, Uncle Barney and Aunt Robin are always in the picture and thus have something to do with how he got together with their mother."

Kulai (unbeknownst to the cadets) is a Chalim priestess from a planet called Pyria, a planet that was strip-mined by a warlike race called the Triiad, led by the Pyran traitor, Paiyin. The sole purpose of the Triiad is to wipe out intelligent races, and in the process acquire raw materials from their destroyed planets to continually create new war machines using automated self-replicating factory ships called \"Makers.\" The Hypernauts, as they name themselves, cannot match the Triiad's firepower with their own so they must rely on stealth, wits and (occasionally) their modified 'mech suits' in order to escape the Triiad. They are based in an ancient abandoned exploration ship called the Star Ranger which is hidden in an asteroid field, the Star Ranger's obsolete AI is named Horten. For long range missions they use a four person shuttle called the Flapjack which like the Star Ranger is Hyper Bubble capable but has a much shorter range. The Triiad have englobed the central region of the Milky Way Galaxy in a sensor net that can identify the destination point of any hyperspace jump passing out of it, so returning home would lead the Triiad directly to Earth. The Hypernauts must keep the location of Earth a secret and somehow try to warn Earth of the Triiad's existence."

The evidence is examined closely in forensic studies of what makes these rock 'n' roll types tick, starting with the lead singer. Often he's the leader, sometimes the dictator, benign or otherwise. His voice is his instrument and out front there's nowhere to hide. He hires. He fires. And when it all goes wrong and the backlash begins, he will get the blame."

We don't even think twice about it as we fill in the name of our spouse, our parents, our sibling, our best friend. But what if you had no one? What if you looked at that question and struggled to come up with one single person that you could contact if there was a real emergency? Today is a turning point for three high school buddies who find themselves in places they never would have expected, and learn that in one day they can start with no one to count on, but can finish being able to count on each other."

After months of rehabilitation and medication, the zombies (now referred to as partially deceased syndrome (PDS) patients by the government, but pejoratively known as \"rotters\") are judged ready to return to society, their homes and families. They are given cosmetics and contact lenses, so they can 'pass,' and to conceal their partially deceased status. They must maintain a strict program of medication to avoid going \"rabid\" again, which is one injection a day. Many are haunted by returning memories of the atrocities they committed while rabid.

The story focuses on Rosemary, Jane and Emily, who represent mothers we all know. Rosemary is a free-wheeling mom who plays it fast and loose when it comes to parenting her teenaged son, Luke. Married numerous times, but currently single, Rosemary lives by her own rules. Much to the amazement of the other moms, her nontraditional parenting style has yielded a son much more responsible than she. Rosemary's best friend, Jane, is a recently divorced working mother of a pre-teen, Annie, and a baby girl, Sophie, who is just trying to keep her career and home afloat. Having just returned to work after giving birth eight months ago, Jane struggles to find a happy balance - lucky for her she has her \"manny,\" Horatio, to help out. Jane's younger sister, Emily, sees herself as the model stay-at-home-super-mom for her two young children, Esther and Bill. Emily's home is a work of art, and her kids are polite and sweet-everything has its place in her world. Married to Jason, Emily takes parenting as seriously as any mother could. As for the men in their lives, Horatio, Jane's \"manny,\" communicates with Jane's infant daughter through sign language and believes the baby is the only person who really \"gets\" him. He's a good-hearted lug who is also much more than a babysitter to the three ladies. Then there's Jason, Emily's husband, who is the uptight breadwinner, ready at any given moment to open a vein for his family. He likes his food to be organic and his wife, home and children at the top of their class. Basically he's an ulcer waiting to happen."

The series takes a satirical look at the life of a c-grade celebrity and brings the society supplements of the newspapers to frightening fruition as Jaquie encounters, romances and bitch-slaps many of New Zealand’s most well known celebrities."

    "description": "In this BBC drama series, Mr Justice Deed (played by Martin Shaw) is an unusual English High Court judge. An idealistic lawyer from a working-class background, Deed has got near to the top of his profession by his intellect, his charm, and an obsessive belief in justice. Judge Deed wants to uphold the law (and his own independence) at all costs, and this leaves him at odds with a series of British government stooges who try to influence his decisions.Outside court, Deed is a womanizer who has an up-and-down relationship with fellow barrister Jo Mills (played by Jenny Seagrove), and his glamorous ex-wife Georgina Channing (another barrister, played by Caroline Langrishe) is somehow never quite out of his life. He and Georgina have a daughter called Charlie (Louisa Clein), at first a law student, later a young barrister, whose escapades have a way of getting Deed into hot water. Row Colemore (Christopher Cazenove) is a senior Metropolitan Police officer and one of Deed's oldest friends."

The cartoon series twisted the film's premise around, but most of the characters remained the same. As in the film, young Peter and Judy Shepherd came to live with their Aunt Nora. Exploring the house, they found in the attic a dusty old board game called Jumanji. Kids will be kids, and soon enough Peter and Judy had the game out and ready for play, little knowing that the game had a life of its own. When they rolled the dice, a rhymed message appeared on the board, and Peter and Judy were sucked inside a strange jungle world. Lost and alone in this frightening new land, Peter and Judy ran across long-haired jungle man Alan Parrish (the Robin Williams character in the film), who had been sucked in by Jumanji many years earlier. The three joined forces, looking for a way out."

Being the only female ranger in this elite squad isn't going to stop Molly Parker, she's ballsy and badass enough to get the job done despite a good-ole network filled with harassment and discrimination. In another profession, being a stunning former beauty queen might open doors but for Molly... that distinction only makes it harder. Molly is committed to finding the truth and seeing justice served; a trait no doubt inherited from her father, a former Texas sheriff. She's even willing to break some rules to get it done."

John Leguizamo is \"Mr. Wolf,\" the leader of a small group of military veterans who set out to rob a major bank in Pittsburgh. When things go awry, they're forced to take more than a dozen hostages from all walks of life, including a wealthy and powerful businessman's daughter. Suddenly, \"Mr. Wolf\" finds himself battling the police, the hostages and members of his own team while at the same time, fighting his own personal demons from the Iraq war and from his own war at home. Will he be sharp enough to hold it all together or lose control of the situation? And will he find redemption before it's too late -- and does he even care to? On the opposite side of the perimeter is \"Horst Cali,\" the Pittsburgh Police Department Hostage Negotiator, played by Donnie Wahlberg, who must go toe-to-toe with \"Mr. Wolf.\" \"Cali\" must use his wit and negotiating skills, while managing his own personal issues, to manipulate the situation and convince Wolf to free the hostages before the FBI takes control, or worse. With time of the essence and the uncertainty of the unfolding events, both men need to remain resourceful and collected or risk losing lives. THE KILL POINT reveals how the hostage takers leverage their situation and how the negotiator tries to unravel their plans. Which man will blink? Who will outsmart the other? Who will survive? It's a dangerous game of chess played out with human lives at stake."

The series was inspired by the role-playing game Vampire: the Masquerade by Mark Rein Hagen but took many liberties such as allowing vampires who have recently fed to withstand sunlight. The many changes from the source material alienated some fans of the game, and the series never found its mainstream audience, ending after only seven episodes had aired."

Will she survive her new job as head of the Major Crimes Task Force? Jess is a powerhouse and a force of nature, a cop who sees things that everyone else misses. She says what she thinks, and she never stops thinking – about a crime scene, about evidence, about the motivations of the suspects. Professionally and in private, Jess faces two challenges: to save her third marriage and to prove that she’s the best cop in town. Jess’ unit takes over cases already in progress: murder, rape, robbery, gang violence, serial crime – the most volatile and challenging cases that the ordinary police force has failed to solve. Jess can take over any case in the city, whether the original investigating officers want her to or not. She gets to work with a different squad in every case – from the elite Homicide department to the intimidating hulks of Hold-Up, and from the rock-star heroes of the Drug Squad to the shadowy denizens of Organized Crime."

But logging has always been just one way he keeps himself entertained. Now, for the first time, we’re getting an inside look at his life when he’s not logging. Shelby begins this season with a big problem: Hurricane Isaac flooded his houseboat, and now he has nowhere to live. With the help of a boat broker, Shelby must leave the swamp and enter the real world, confronting new experiences that push him well past his comfort level. With great risk comes great reward, though, and Shelby manages to find the perfect houseboat that is as unique as him. The only problem is that it’s way over his budget, and now he’s got a mortgage looming. To keep the bill collectors at bay, Shelby embarks on one odd job after another; nothing is too dangerous or bizarre for Shelby to try. From working at a gator farm to clearing swamp rats from a house and from deep sea fishing to hog hunting, Shelby will do it all but always on his own terms. This is Shelby’s world with Shelby’s rules. This is the Legend of Shelby the Swamp Man."

The show was then followed, in the same season, by Gunsmoke on CBS, Frontier on NBC and Wyatt's fellow ABC show Cheyenne. It was these four shows alone that started an incredible and unmatched phenomena that would see up to 28 new westerns premiering during the 1958 primetime TV season. But only a handful of them were able to dominate a few of the top 10 spots in the network ratings and Wyatt Earp was one of them. Wyatt Earp was inspired by the legendary events of the real life Frontier Marshal who lived from 1848 to 1929. The show followed Earp from his days as a Marshal in Ellsworth and then later Dodge City (this caused some confusion amongst viewers since Matt Dillion was the Marshal of Dodge City in Gunsmoke) and finally"

    "description": "Brian Pern (Day) is an ageing rock star and former front-man of ground breaking progressive rock group Thotch. Like many artists of his age, rather than make new music, he spends more time trying to save the planet (including his campaign to teach gorillas how to Skype). Now, the BBC have asked him to front a major new documentary where he presents his guide to The Life Of Rock from prehistoric man to the present day, in a spoof three-part chronology of some of the biggest moments in rock history. Thotch band members and former Stowe classmates Pat Quid, guitarist (Fast Show colleague Paul Whitehouse) and keyboard player Tony Pebble – pronounced Pebblé (Nigel Havers) - join Brian to reminisce about their heyday and beyond. Matt Lucas and Michael Kitchen also star as Brian’s legendary producer Ray Thomas, and his infamous manager John Farrow respectively, with the likes of Vic Reeves and Bob Mortimer, and David Baddiel popping up as talking heads. With guests from the world of music playing versions of themselves, including Jools Holland, Rick Wakeman, David Arnold and Roger Taylor, Brian (Day) takes rock lovers on a re-imagined history of the genre. The Life Of Rock With Brian Pern is made by BBC Comedy Productions for BBC Four. It is directed and produced by Rhys Thomas and the executive producer is Saurabh Kakkar."

No matter the situation, life's little challenges always manage to demand the most offensive solutions, which wouldn't be such a problem if he weren't continually caught red-handed. From the mind of Steve Dildarian - the Clio-winning ad man behind Budweiser's famous 'Lizards' campaign - 'The Life and Times of Tim' follows this everyday working guy from one scandalous crisis to the next."

    "description": "Maid Marian and her Merry Men is a UK children's television series created and written by Tony Robinson and directed by David Bell. It began in 1989 on BBC One and ran for four series, with the last episode shown in 1994. The show was a partially-musical comic retelling of the legend of Robin Hood, placing Maid Marian in the role of leader of the Merry Men, and reducing Robin to an incompetent ex-tailor. The programme was much appreciated by children and adults alike, and has been likened to Blackadder, not only for its historical setting and the presence of Tony Robinson, but also for its comic style. It is far more surreal than Blackadder, however, and drops even more (deliberate) anachronisms. Like many British children's programmes, there is a lot of social commentary sneakily inserted, as well as witty asides about the Royal family, buses running on time, etc. Many of the plots featured, included or revolved around spoofing particular things, including films such as Jurassic Park and It Came From Outer Space, and television programmes, including The Crystal Maze and the long-running televised fundraiser Comic Relief. There were also frequent references to other Robin Hood incarnations, most notably ITV's Robin of Sherwood (and in particular a parody of that series' Clannad soundtrack is lampooned in the episode \"The Whitish Knight\") and the contemporary film adaptation Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves. The latter actually features Howard Lew Lewis (Rabies) among its cast - hence his doubly-witty line in the episode \"The Came from Outer Space\", which episode also passingly satirises the film for casting the lead with an American accent (Kevin Costner). The show was such a success, there was an adaptation produced for the stage, a cartoon strip by Paul Cemmick which was serialised in the Daily Telegraph's children's paper \"The Young Telegraph\" (also available as a series of collections) and the programme was repeated on BBC One in 2001. Series 1 was released on video in 1990, with three episodes each on two tapes (a couple of slight variations in cover design exist for each), and all four series are available on DVD"

    "description": "A Man Called Hawk is a spin-off of the Robert Urich drama Spenser: For Hire. Hawk, played by Avery Brooks, moves back to his hometown of Washington, D.C. Hawk is tough and streetwise, a man who is erudite with a booming baritone voice who dresses fly while fighting crime -- despite the fact that he lacks the \"official\" credentials to do so. His mentor and father figure is the \"Old Man.\" Although many critics dismissed Brooks' portrayal in the series as stiff and one-dimensional, Brooks himself described Hawk as \"a contemporary, mythological brown hero.\" Although steeped in mystery, Hawk was clearly very proud of his heritage -- his home was filled with African sculptures and artifacts. We also learn that Hawk is a Vietnam War veteran, a former boxer and is skilled at playing jazz piano. The series premiered in January 1989 as a mid-season replacement. Its ratings suffered and the show was cancelled after just one season."

The problem, he concluded, was that by the time a spy was recruited, trained, and ready to go into the field, the enemy had identified and targeted them for assassination. Lavender's idea was to begin recruiting everday Americans with special skills to become temporary spies who could participate in one mission then return quietly to their normal lives. Once assembled, they would travel together as a group of tourists visiting a foreign country -- sight-seeing by day and collaborating on their mission by night. When the mission was completed, they would each receive pay equivalent to a year's salary (no taxes) and go their separate ways. While Lavender oversaw the missions, his assistants Danny and Casey kept careful tabs on the recruits,"

Sydney Andrews (Laura Leighton, the original \"Melrose Place\") is the landlady, still beautiful at 40, and a central figure in the lives of all her tenants, especially handsome and rebellious David Breck (Shaun Sipos, \"Shark\"). Sydney started an affair with David despite her turbulent history with his estranged father, Dr. Michael Mancini (Thomas Calabro, the original \"Melrose Place\"). Both father and son learned through experience that Sydney was not above using blackmail to control people. Another tenant, high-powered publicist Ella Simms (Katie Cassidy, \"Supernatural\"), once considered Sydney her mentor, but their friendship was destroyed by betrayal, and Sydney threatened to evict Ella and ruin her career. Sydney also played a pivotal role in the career of Auggie Kirkpatrick (Colin Egglesfield, \"All My Children\"). After they met at an AA meeting, she became Auggie's sponsor and encouraged his dream to become a chef. Now a successful sous chef at the trendy restaurant Coal, Auggie has been avoiding Sydney since she began drinking again. The other tenants include Lauren Yung (Stephanie Jacobsen, \"Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles\"), a medical student in desperate need of money to pay her student loans, and Jonah Miller (Michael Rady, \"Swingtown\"), an aspiring filmmaker who has just proposed to his live-in girlfriend Riley Richmond (Jessica Lucas, \"Cloverfield\"), a first-grade teacher. The newest tenant, 18-year-old Violet Foster (Ashlee Simpson-Wentz, \"7th Heaven\"), has just arrived in LA with her own secret connection to Sydney. When a bloody body is found floating in the courtyard pool, David is the leading suspect. However, as the police are soon to discover, almost everyone living at Melrose Place had a reason to want the deceased out of the way."

Eustace Conway, who has lived at the western edge of the Blue Ridge Mountains in North Carolina for more than 25 years, teaches interns about the old ways of living with nature. Tom Oar needs an entire year to prepare for the seven-month-long winter on Montana's Yaak River.

Columbo's wife had often been referred to in the series but was never actually shown. However, after 'Columbo' was cancelled in 1978, NBC decided to create a spin-off series featuring Mrs. Columbo and so 'Kate Loves a Mystery' was born. 'Kate Loves a Mystery' premiered in February 1979 under the title 'Mrs. Columbo' and starred Kate Mulgrew as Kate Columbo, wife of the famous detective. Kate is a housewife who raises the couple's daughter Jenny (played by Lili Haydn) but also works as a reporter for a newspaper called The Valley Advocate edited by Josh Alden (played by Henry Jones). Working for the paper gets Kate involved in all sorts of mysteries which she has to solve. Unfortunately, audiences did not warm up to the series and 'Mrs. Columbo' was taken off the air after five episodes."

The show depicts the daily lives of Draper's sons, who lead a faux rock band from New York City. As a mockumentary, the storyline is a hyperbole of their real lives, and the fictional presence of a camera is often acknowledged. Lead vocals and instrumentation are provided by the siblings; they wrote the lyrics themselves. The show stars Nat Wolff and Alex Wolff. Nat's preschool pals—David Levi and Thomas Batuello—feature as band members. Allie DiMeco plays Nat's female admirer and band member Rosalina, Qaasim Middleton portrays the band's guitarist, Cooper Pillot plays the group's manager, the siblings' cousin (Jesse Draper) portrays the group's ditzy nanny Jesse Cook, and the siblings' jazz pianist father (Michael Wolff) plays their inept accordion-playing dad Mr. Wolff. The series is a spin-off of Draper's film of the same name that was picked up by Nickelodeon, premiering in January 2007. Draper, star of Thirtysomething and her writing The Tic Code, is the executive producer of the series, and often writer and director. Albie Hecht, affiliated with Nickelodeon, is the executive producer, under his Worldwide Biggies tag. The adult Wolff, of The Arsenio Hall Show fame, serves as the music supervisor and co-executive producer. The show premiered in the United States on the network on February 3, 2007. Viacom announced, it \"delivered Nickelodeon's highest-rat[ings] in seven years\" and instantly became one of the most favorable for children aged 6–11.[1] Season one consisted of one television movie which was part of a thirteen episode package, and the second season consisted of two TV movies, eight episodes, and two concert specials. The third season aired four TV movies, one episode, two holiday specials, and one animated special. The series concluded on June 13, 2009."

Within the Howard empire were investigative correspondent Jeff Dillon and editor Dan Farrell. Dillon was a super-agressive former newsboy who had clawed his way up to a position of power and respect working for Howard's People Magazine.

In ``Naked and Afraid,'' two complete strangers -- a man and a woman -- meet in a very unique way: They're stranded in a dangerous, desolate location, without food and water, and they're completely naked. Each episode follows the two as they attempt to survive on their own for 21 days, with nothing but one personal item each and the knowledge that the only prize is their pride and sense of accomplishment. Because there is no other choice, the couple quickly get to know each other -- and their surroundings -- and hope that their instincts, survival skills and intestinal fortitude will serve them well."

Scooby and the gang still found themselves foiling the bad guys in rubber masks like in the original series, but this time around the guest stars would help out and be another source of comedic hijinks.

Their matriarch, \"Ma\" Ketcham (Neva Patterson), soon blackmailed Nichols into serving as the town's sheriff, which carried little real authority (as the Ketchams largely ran things), but considerable danger. Mitch Mitchell (Stuart Margolin) was assigned to be Nichols' deputy, either in spite or because he was none too bright, none too honest, and something of a bully. Nichols (James Garner) soon found a love interest in Ruth (Margot Kidder), a barmaid, who worked for Bertha (Alice Ghostley), the bar's proprietress. Nichols' main concern was not usually law enforcement but rather a way of getting rich with little effort. The series did not do well in the ratings and was retitled James Garner as Nichols in October 1971 in an attempt to capitalize on the star's popularity. The low ratings also resulted in the decision by the program's producers to kill off the title character. The greedy, but pacifist Nichols was shot down, to be avenged by his identical twin brother Jim Nichols (also portrayed by Garner), who arrived in town and administered justice in a more stereotypical (and it was hoped, more popular) Western fashion. This solution would have made recasting and retitling the program unnecessary while allowing for considerable changes. However, the episode in which the first Nichols was murdered proved to be the final one; before it aired, NBC cancelled the series, rerunning the earlier episodes during the summer of 1972."

It is a realistic (if somewhat fast-paced) show that takes real issues facing people today and puts a religious spin on things. It deals with AIDS, abortion, and charity to the poor, among other things. Perhaps the best aspect of the show is its unabashed belief in the existence of God. The main characters pray, and they talk about their faith. We see actual Roman Catholic liturgy in action. We hear homilies that drive the point home.&lt;br&gt; While Nothing Sacred could perhaps be considered too liberal in some circles, it does a very good job of showing many sides of an issue... and the overwhelming message of the show is that we are to love and care for other people, just as Christ did when He was on Earth."

The eight-part series takes a candid look at how cutting edge medicine often makes the difference, although even the best surgeons can find themselves flirting with disaster. The raucous ER staff trade jibes with strong-willed New Yorkers in moments that can be poignantly heartbreaking or off-the-hook hilarious.

Oliver Stone and American University historian Peter J. Kuznick, began working on the project in 2008. Stone, Kuznick and British screenwriter Matt Graham co-wrote the script. The documentary miniseries for Showtime had a working title Oliver Stone's Secret History of America. It covers \"the reasons behind the Cold War with the Soviet Union, U.S. President Harry Truman's decision to drop the atomic bomb on Japan, and changes in America's global role since the fall of Communism.\" Stone is the director and narrator of all ten episodes. The series is a re-examination of some of the under-reported and darkest parts of American modern history using little known documents and newly uncovered archival material. The series looks beyond official versions of events to the deeper causes and implications and explores how events from the past still have resonant themes for the present day. Stone said: \"From the outset I've looked at this project as a legacy to my children, and a way to understand the times I've lived through. I hope it can contribute to a more global insight into our American history.\""

After a global search already under way, applicants will be winnowed to a group of 16 talented filmmakers. These finalists will be brought to Hollywood, where they will be divided into teams and will begin the journey toward their \"big break.\" Every week, the hopeful filmmakers will produce short films from a chosen genre, running the gamut from comedies to thrillers, personal dramas to romance, sci-fi to horror. They'll have access to the best resources the industry has to offer -- professional writers, cast and crew, and possibly even Hollywood celebrities. After the teams have battled time frames, budgets and all the usual chaos that goes along with filmmaking, their films will debut and be critiqued in front of a live audience during the \"Film Premiere\" episode. Judges will include a high-ranking motion picture executive, a prominent film critic and a succession of well-respected guests, such as directors who are experts in the week's featured genre. It will be FOX viewers whose votes determine which films should be left on the cutting-room floor. On each \"Box Office\" results show, the director whose feature garners the fewest votes will be sent home. The competition continues and directors are eliminated until only the most talented filmmaker is anointed the winner and heads to DreamWorks, to be met by Steven Spielberg and shown to his or her new office on the lot."

When patriarch Wolfgang West is sentenced to four years in jail, his wife Cheryl decides enough is enough; the family are cleaning up their act and going straight. Can the Wests live up to Cheryl's resolve and stay out of crime? It's not easy to be a saint when you have the DNA of a sinner. Outrageous Fortune follows one cheerfully trashy crime family's attempts to stay out of trouble: matriarch Cheryl, determined to save her brood from following in their father's footsteps, eldest son Jethro, an ambitious lawyer-to-be with a few secrets, Jethro's twin Van (identical except in the brains department) who only wants to be like his dad, 18-year-old Pascalle, who wants to be Rachel Hunter, 15-year-old movie buff Loretta, who is blackmailing her teacher, and Grandpa Ted, who may have Alzheimer's - unless he's just playing it up to annoy people. Then there's Detective Sergeant Wayne Judd, the West family nemesis; the Hongs, a wealthy Asian family who may or may not have Triad connections, Caroline Darling, Loretta's deputy principal, who has been having an affair with Jethro since he was a 15-year-old student, Munter, Van's best mate and partner in crime, and Wolf himself, who does not intend to take his wife's sudden wave of righteousness lying down. Outrageous Fortune is a family comedy-drama about the wrong sort of people trying to do the right thing when the rewards for going straight are neither immediate nor bountiful. Outrageous Fortune is a bold, fresh comedy-drama which is by turns bawdy, action-packed, satirical and trashy - but only ever a heartbeat away from reality."

Moffett), who, after serving three years in prison, is released on parole and accepts an offer to become the head of security for the posh Palace Hotel chain. There were two reasons for this somewhat unusual job offer. One was that Logan had previously enjoyed great success in stealing from the high-class clientele of the Palace chain, and hence it was thought that he'd understand how to prevent others from doing so. And the other was that Tommy was the illegitimate son of the chain's owner, Arturo Taft (Tony Lo Bianco), though Taft did not reveal this to Logan. The show centered primarily around the working relationship between Logan and his new boss, Christy Cooper (Marcy Walker), the hotel chain's Vice-President of Public Relations. In each episode, Logan and Cooper travelled to a hotel in a different city where Logan would help avert some disaster using quirky and questionable methods, leaving Cooper to sweep up the fallout. Nine episodes of Palace Guard were produced, however the show was pulled from the CBS lineup after only three episodes had been aired."

Zak Bagans invites two handpicked teams of amateur ghost hunters to spend the night locked down in these notorious locations. The contest will pit the two teams paranormal skills against each other to find out who comes out on top. Each team is given high-tech gear to investigate these intense hotspots. After a night of collecting evidence, the teams present their findings to Zak Bagans and a panel of three judges who are nationally recognized paranormal experts.

Their parents want to “keep an eye on them” during their work experience, so they are all working with each other’s parents. Jack is at the law firm run by Granville’s dad, Ashton. Phil, however, is appalled by the idea of raising a lawyer in his own home. He thinks Jack should concentrate on being a rock star instead. Granville is overjoyed at the prospect of his placement at Sandy’s salon, where he is convinced there will be lots of “fine ladies”. And Eddie will be working with Phil, who plans for him to make his own guitar. Phil is hoping for another date with Sandy, so sending Eddie home with his fingers intact is probably a pre-requisite. Later, Phil is horrified to find a packet of cigarettes in Jack’s room. He confronts his son and makes a deal – if Jack packs in the cigarettes, he’ll pack in his coffee. Unsurprisingly, Phil finds that cranberry juice just isn’t the same as a good, strong coffee, and it’s not long before his caffeine withdrawal starts to take effect… Jack is played by Peter Losasso, Granville by Franz Drameh, Eddie by David Barseghian, Ashton by Colin McFarlane, Phil by Jimmy Nail and Sandy by Niky Wardley."

Just like his best friends, Jerry Steiner and Mikey Randall and his girlfriend Annie Sloan, his prime concern is achieving and maintaining \"coolness\" during the turbulent years of puberty. However, their efforts are often thwarted by Parker's little sister, Shelly, and principal Grace Musso. Apart from various aspects of teenage life, embedded in a surreal, living-cartoon-like quality and the clever camera angles and filming techniques (dissolves from one scene to the next were done by ever larger pixels), an episode regularly contains more or less subtle references to movies, politics, and celebrities. The 3,100 students are called \"Flamingos\", after their football team."

It's no wonder their personal lives are so messy. Sons of an ex-Labour MP, Scott and Danny Foster have politics in their blood. Danny is the devoted researcher of Home Office Junior Minister, Jo Porter. But times are tough. The government is in crisis, Jo's struggling with a difficult home life and Danny is caught in the crossfire. Add to this, the distracting presence of scheming intern Kirsty MacKenzie, and Danny is about to make an almighty blunder. Scott fled Labour HQ with a bulging contacts book for a lucrative career in lobbying. But with New Labour in decline, Scott's schmoozing methods and contacts are looking a little dated. A chance lunch with Ashika Chandrimani, chief advisor to Shadow Minister James Northcote, presents an opportunity that Scott is eager to pursue. Ashika herself is at a crossroads. Boss James may be tipped as future Tory cabinet material, but she's tired of living in his shadow and the rumours surrounding their relationship. So when she is approached to fight a critical by-election, Ashika has to choose between future power with James and the chance to strike out on her own. Danny's mistake and a scurrilous rumour set in motion a chain of events that bind all four characters together – and change their lives forever."

From writer David Hudgins (\"Friday Night Lights\"), and inspired by the book \"The Reincarnationist\" by M.J. Rose, comes PAST LIFE, a new drama series about an unlikely pair of past-life detectives who investigate whether what is happening to you today is the result of who you were before. DR. KATE MCGINN (Kelli Giddish, \"All My Children\") is not your typical psychologist. Confident, outspoken and highly educated, she works at The Talmadge Center for Behavioral Health in New York City, a world-renowned institute dedicated to the study of the science of the soul. After experiencing a past-life regression in her 20s, Kate became a believer in reincarnation. Using regression therapy and her natural gift for reading people, Kate helps solve the mysteries of her troubled clients who suffer from present-day problems caused by past-life traumas. She believes there are levels of consciousness and explanations for human behavior that science can't begin to explain. Accustomed to skeptics, but not bothered by them, Kate is an unapologetic believer and a force of nature who marches to the beat of her own drummer. Her partner, PRICE WHATLEY (Nicholas Bishop, \"Home and Away\"), is a different story. A former NYPD homicide detective, pragmatic and cynical, Price is a damaged soul who constantly battles grief and guilt over the accidental death of his wife. Price feels that Kate, though not certifiable, certainly operates on the fringes of science. It's a volatile relationship, but with Price's solid detective skills, and Kate's penchant for out-of-the-box thinking, together they make a formidable, if somewhat dysfunctional, team. A fast-paced emotional thrill ride, each episode finds Price and Kate working with their colleagues to unravel a new mystery involving the past-lives of their clients. DR. MALACHI TALMADGE (Richard Schiff, \"The West Wing\") is Kate's mentor and the center's namesake, an avuncular but gruff elder statesman who is a legend in the field of cognitive research. DR. RISHI KARNA (Ravi Patel, \"Scrubs\") is the rookie of the group, a baby-faced therapist from Calcutta who loves bad American TV, Cuban jazz and driving everyone crazy."

    "description": "The sitcom focuses on the lives of five overpaid and underworked employees at fictional advertising agency HHH&H. The uncontrollable urge-bag Keaton (Simon Farnaby) peruses the workplace for new conquests – everyone he hasn’t already had. Billy (Iain Lee), the intelligent underachiever, indulges in his role as the office menace. Spoilt neurotic Emma (Daisy Haggard) would like to break the glass ceiling, but only if it doesn’t damage her lovely hair. Boss Clive (Jarred Christmas), the most Australian man on the planet, exults in his position as the ridiculous manager. The hopeless, witless and feckless Greg (Adam Buxton) is the eager Account Director desperately aspiring to be as ambitious and amoral as his colleagues. Over the course of the series viewers will witness the five advertising degenerates battle their way through a variety of scenarios from having to sell a brown smelly ‘cockney cheese’ for disillusioned, aggressive and frightening cockney client, Jim (Lee Ross). Issues of beauty are tackled in episode two, as Emma becomes the ‘Head of Handsomeness’ and creates the ‘corridor of beauty’, placing the uglier colleagues in the boiler room. Later in the series Keaton, the Head of Global, becomes impotent as he learns that women are “somehow human too”. Keaton and Billy engage on a war of being impractical and battle it out to prove they are not mature and sensible. Emma embraces the new ‘Diet Stuff’ drink a little too enthusiastically and begins protesting against obesity. Billy experiences the frustration of writer’s block and Keaton sets out to steal his colleagues’ happiness."

After the episode was complete, Chrome would conclude Perversions of Science. Most episodes focused on a part of science fiction such as alien invasion or space/time travel."

More specifically, Tommy Cadle's lighthouse hideaway. That's right! Pet Aliens have crashed into the top of the lighthouse tower and made themselves at home. Unfortunately, the earth boy living there was none-too-keen on this house invasion. When Tommy woke to be greeted by a big, slobbering Gumpers, he did what any kid would do when faced with being devoured by a pink, fuzzy, lovable alien: he ran and fell off the top of his lighthouse!

She was the tennis player we all wish we could be (well, not really). However, she was good none-the-less. Her pushy coach Lou strives and keeps on her to be the best she can be. Her mother, Dianne Doolan, who is a little flighty but still down to Earth, is the best she can be at being a single mother. Angela also has a flakey brother Brian. He's the sensitive type that you just wanna hug and cuddle with, but don't let him do your homework! Last, but not least, is the little sister, Mary Margaret, who is quick with the tongue sword and puts the \"fun\" in this dysfunctional family!"

Over the course of 33 days, these pirates will live aboard a massive 179 foot, square-rigged barque and will embark on extraordinary expeditions while deciphering clues along the way. Gold coins will be given out after each expedition, but not to everyone. This gold plays a key role as pirates make deals with each other or maneuver for long-term security. One pirate will also be made captain of the ship and will assign roles and chores to the remaining crew members. This sets the tone for either law and order, or betrayal and sabotage - against which the crew can choose to mutiny. Each episode finishes on the ship at Pirate's Court, a lively gathering not unlike Survivor's, in which one individual is eliminated and \"cut adrift.\" One pirate will eventually be the first to find the greatest booty, worth $500,000, and claim the title of \"Pirate Master.\""

Plebs follows three desperate young men from the suburbs as they try to get laid, hold down jobs and climb the social ladder in the big city - a city that happens to be Ancient Rome. The show follows Marcus, Stylax and their lazy slave with an attitude problem, Grumio. There's also the boys' ruthless boss, Flavia - an expert manipulator with a private life that's the stuff of legend. Unlikely to be immortalized in the annals or memorialized in a frieze, Marcus, Stylax and Grumio are essentially just a bunch of Plebs.

Journeying from Tokyo and Thailand, to Paris and Rio, to Uganda, Morocco and India -- the cast is met in each city by a \"beauty ambassador\" who helps them tackle topics revolving around fashion, fitness, diet and outlandish spa treatments. In each country, Jessica, Ken and CaCee experience firsthand some of the local beauty rituals, from drinking cow urine in India, to being buried up to their necks in Tokyo, to drinking gourds of ghee in a fattening hut in Uganda. But it's not all fun and games -- Jessica also explores the high price that some women pay to feel beautiful.

Throughout the program, the viewing audience will be challenged to figure out which one of the three stories will be revealed to be \"proof positive.\""

When your child comes to you and says, \"I see dead people.\" What do you do with that information? There are parents who are scared and isolated with problems that they often keep quiet - issues dealing with their children's paranormal abilities. Now, thanks to Medium Chip Coffey and renowned psychologist and Columbia University professor, Dr. Lisa Miller, help is on the way. Each one-hour episode features three kids who ultimately are brought together by Chip and Lisa to learn how to cope with their gifts and to realize they are not alone. Medium Chip Coffey utilizes both his abilities in the paranormal and his Masters Degree in Psychology when he deals with children who are showing signs of possessing psychic and medium abilities. Chip aims to help the children with the supernatural phenomenon he or she is experiencing: how to manage this lifelong \"gift\" and the burdens that sometimes go along with the paranormal abilities. Dr. Lisa helps the children and families deal with the inter-family conflict they may be experiencing. From seeing dead people to frightening abilities to predict the future, Chip and Lisa will uncover the truths and help the terrified and gifted. In the end, \"Psychic Kids: Children of the Paranormal,\" is an intense journey of a medium and a psychologist, who draw on their own personal experiences, training, and unique outlook on life to teach troubled kids how to deal with what they often feel is a curse, as much as a unique and special gift."

In RAT BUSTERS NYC, New York's finest and most entertaining exterminators, Jimmy Tallman and Michael Morales of Magic Exterminating (a New York City and Long Island based company) invite cameras to see just what's 'rat'tling New Yorkers. These Brooklyn-born pest experts strip away the city's protective veil as they bring the reality of the army of vermin that are a part of The Big Apple's immense population to light - and they're everywhere - from warehouses and small businesses to apartments and single-family homes, from the Upper East Side to Tribeca and crawling all over Brooklyn and Queens! Beginning Friday, August 26, at 10 PM et/pt, six hour-long episodes of RAT BUSTERS NYC follow service managers Jimmy and Michael, a comedic dynamic duo with a brother-like kinship, as they tackle rat families bigger than their own, and other metropolitan pests like roaches, mice, bedbugs, raccoons and pigeons."

    "description": "Revival of the 1970s sitcom The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin. Creator David Nobbs has co-written six new 30-minute episodes for this series, with the help of Men Behaving Badly writer Simon Nye. Reggie Perrin retells the story of a sales executive on the edge. An average man finding it increasingly difficult to put up with the monotony of life, the disappointing marriage, the office grind and the daily commute. Rebellion begins to build in his mind, in the form of increasingly surreal flights of fancy. And, slowly, Reggie begins to say what he really thinks, to his wife, to his boss, to his fellow commuters... and, most dangerously of all, to his new colleague, the beautiful Jasmine Strauss. Executive producer Phil Clarke told Broadcast magazine that this project (Objective's first studio sitcom and its first comedy commission for BBC1) is aiming to deliver an accessible family show for a pre-watershed slot. Martin Clunes plays the lead character, and an impressive cast list including Wendy Craig and Geoffrey Whitehead back him up. Clarke continues: \"Reggie's still a man in crisis with the modern world, but what's interesting is to look at where the world has changed since the 1970s and where it hasn't. He won't, for example, dictate memos to his secretary and he'll be using email. It's an opportunity to comment on the modern world without being heavy-handed.\""

Popularly known as NorBAC, which had been created to investigate (and in some cases terminate) examples of questionable biotechnology. Though mankind had advanced to the point of being able to create \"perfect\" food, luxury items and even babies in the lab, not everyone was motivated by altruism,and there were plenty of madmen and terrorists with deep pockets who intended to use high-tech science for evil purposes."

    "description": "\"Relapse\" is an intense, emotionally charged series that follows the country's leading sober coaches as they work to save the lives of addicts who have turned back to drugs and alcohol. More than 50% of addicts who get sober will relapse, and addicts who continue to do so, generally need one-on-one help. Sober coaches are former addicts who have found their way back to clean living. They dedicate their lives to giving individualized attention to those who can't break their destructive habits. The coaches are often a last resort for addicts who have tried other methods to get sober but have failed. Each episode of \"Relapse\" follows two sober coaches over the course of a week as they work one-on-one with addicts to get them through painful withdrawal symptoms, face personal challenges and reconnect with family and friends who have lost hope. The coaches know the road back to sobriety and will do whatever it takes, no matter how drastic, to help the clients get sober. For the first time ever, viewers will be invited to ride along with sober coaches as they jump into the lives of their clients, forming a bond that is the heart of every"

A miniscule budget combined with an overworked staff made daily programming a challenge, but the staff of WENN always rose to the occasion, usually with hilarious results. As much as the show was praised, Remember WENN only lasted 4 seasons (each season was 13 episodes except for season 3 which had 17), airing from 1996 to 1998. Reruns are no longer available.

In June of 2003, Ren and Stimpy returned with 3 all-new episodes (which used plots developed for the original Nick show), plus the classic episodes the way they were meant to be seen. The show continues the adventures of the duo from the cult classic cartoon series, placing them in a completely No-Nickelodeon-Censorship universe. Originally 6 episodes were due to appear during the summer of 2003 but were delayed for a year along with the rest of Spike's \"Strip\" (mainly because of the extremely risque \"Naked Beach Frenzy\" episode). Spike TV planned to bring the show back with the final remaining episodes on August 20th, 2004, but instead delayed the series once again and canceled the series in early December."

Analyzing that hidden-camera footage is restaurateur Willie Degel, who owns a chain of steakhouses in New York. After seeing how the staff acts, Degel uses his tough-love approach to improve the employees' work ethic and, ultimately, turn around the restaurant's fortunes. If employees don't improve their poor working habits, Degel shows them the door because his goal is making things better for the struggling eatery's owner."

More than 1,000 new restaurants open every year in Britain; unfortunately, approximately 50% close within two years. The Restaurant features couples, some of whom have little or no experience other than cooking at home and throwing dinner parties, but whose dream is to run their own eatery. They have to create their perfect restaurant and then open the doors to the paying public. Their first crucial decision – who will take on the kitchen and who is best equipped to run the front of house? It's a dream that many couples have entertained. Secretly perhaps we all think we could run a restaurant. It's so simple. Lots of us can cook. We have all been to restaurants. We all think we know what people like to eat. If only we had the money and the opportunity. For one couple this programme will realise that dream. During the eight-week series every decision, every mistake the couples make, every argument they have, will be caught on camera. They are working and living together 24-hours a day, under enormous pressure. Each of the nine couples takes over an empty restaurant, makes it their own and will open their doors to the paying public. Every week each restaurant is visited by Raymond's panel of \"inspectors\" – restaurant industry experts Lee Cash, Sarah Willingham and John Lederer. Raymond will then select the three restaurants he judges to be the worst performing and they will be given a tough specific challenge. They must prove in this challenge that they are good enough to stay open. Each week, one of the restaurants will be eliminated from the competition by Raymond, acting as judge and advised by his panel. The restaurant that fails the challenge will have its doors shut. Raymond's decision is the one that counts. By the end of the series just one couple and one restaurant will be left. The winning couple will be given the opportunity to set up a brand new restaurant, financially backed and personally supported by Raymond Blanc."

Unlike the film, its sequels, and the 1974 live-action television series, which involved a primitive ape civilization, Return to the Planet of the Apes depicted a technologically advanced society, complete with automobiles, film, and television; as such it more closely resembled both Boulle's original novel and early concepts for the first Apes movie which were changed due to budgetary limitations in the late 1960s."

Archie has travelled back from the future to spend some time with his hero forefather, using technology destined to be invented by ideas initiated by Stanley and his descendants. According to Archie (and his super computer, Olivia), Stanley's brilliant insights are what make him special - his curiosity, his ability to make connections, to experiment, evaluate, and persist in finding a solution where other people would give up. In fact, according to Archie, Stanley Brown was the first in a line of geniuses who kick started loads of incredible advancements and inventions for future generations. Archie has arrived to witness first hand, observe and learn from the brilliant Stanley Brown... as well as coming to have some fun. Unfortunately, no one but Stanley can see or hear Archie so there's no one but Archie who seems to understand or care what an amazing mind Stanley has. At the moment, nobody shares Archie's belief in Stanley - certainly not his mum or sister Steph, who both wish Stan was a little more 'average' and a lot less trouble. Archie uses reality-bending powers to show us the unseen world around us in microscopic detail, covering a broad spectrum of content from human biology to physics via explosive chemistry and gory zoology. Together, the two of them open our eyes to the wonders of science - but often misjudge the impact of their experiments, as an explosion of science, comedy and chaos unfolds. Archie's arrival may make Stanley's life a lot more complex, but it's a lot more fun too - even if he still has to cope with his mum's constant cleaning, as well as Jess the street-smart and confrontational girl next door, and having to look out for his accident-prone friend Mike. Stanley Brown has a lot on his plate, but if anyone can cope with the arrival of a back-packing time-travelling tourist, Stanley can!"

And without any modern technology, who can tell us why? Now, 15 years later, life is back to what it once was long before the industrial revolution: families living in quiet cul-de-sacs, and when the sun goes down lanterns and candles are lit. Life is slower and sweeter. Or is it? On the fringes of small farming communities, danger lurks. And a young woman's life is dramatically changed when a local militia arrives and kills her father, who mysteriously - and unbeknownst to her - had something to do with the blackout.

Throwing another spanner in the works is Vicky’s divorced father James Nicholls (Tony Britton). He thoroughly disapproves of Robin and the fact that he’s living in sin with his daughter. Since he owns both the Fulham flat that Robin and Vicky live in and the empty restaurant underneath, he’s well-placed to exert a bit of moral blackmail – particularly when Robin decides the restaurant would make the ideal premises for his own little bistro."

Middle daughter Nikki returns from filming B-movie thriller The Squid (They're Killermari!). Long-term boyfriend Leo (Mathew Horne) proposes, only to find she's returned with a new boyfriend - the public school rugger-boy Seb (Nicholas Burns). Meanwhile, eldest daughter Jenny (Sarah Solemani) is the proud mother of baby Nikki. Boyfriend Jase (Chris O'Dowd) has been unable to escape the relationship for several years, through a mixture of bad luck and laziness. Fatherhood is the final straw. As he looks for an escape from his new responsibilities, the baby finds a way of reaching out to him - by speaking to him through the demonic voice of Morwenna Banks. Will Leo will ever get Nikki back? Even by revealing Seb's proclivity for dressing as a baby and being spanked? Spoiled and self-centred but ultimately big-hearted, the Pretty family somehow charm their way through life. Probably because they have an obscene amount of money."

Now Head of Security at Buckingham Palace car park, he is surprisingly appointed as Royal Bodyguard after saving the Queen's life in an act of bravery on the day of the State Opening of Parliament. This is much to the frustration of Hubble's boss Colonel Dennis Whittington, who is desperate to see the back of Hubble and knows only too well about his relentless mishaps. Hubble takes his new role very seriously but soon manages to upset foreign ambassadors, his colleagues and members of the public as he haphazardly carries out his security checks and takes on personal rescue missions for the Queen and her family. Hubble manages to endanger Royal security repeatedly and on a colossal scale, yet somehow comes up smelling of roses every time."

In order to protect these new settlers and maintain laws and regulations in the New Frontier, Earth’s Cavalry Command was created. Cavalry Command was in essence a military organization, maintaining an army and fleet of ships to protect the New Frontier. Within Cavalry Command was a unit of special operatives known as Star Sheriffs that functioned as field agents, investigating crimes and plots against the security of the New Frontier. The main foe of Cavalry Command and the Star Sheriffs was a race of non-human creatures known as Vapor Beings (or Outriders) that jumped into our dimension in order to conquer it. They attacked the settlers, destroyed settlements and kidnapped humans in order to mine various metals or crystals from the soil. Outriders were superior to humans in battle technology, possessing a legion of gigantic robots with uncanny firepower against which the space-going fleets of Cavalry Command were no match. In order to have a chance against such supremacy, Cavalry Command developed a prototype ship known as the \"Ramrod Equalizer Unit\" (or just Ramrod) that had the ability to turn from spaceship into a powerful robot that could fight the Outriders on equal terms."

Dick Blasucci had begun writing for the cast in their second series, SCTV, and joined them here, serving as a recurring straight man for the characters. Tony Rosato and Robin Duke wrote scripts at the beginning of the show as they had before, until quickly leaving to write and perform for Saturday Night Live.

While walking home after her first day of junior high school, she is nearly hit by a truck from a chemical plant, and during the incident, she is drenched with a top-secret chemical called GC-161. She soon discovers that it gave her strange powers. These include telekinesis, the ability to zap bolts of electricity from her fingers, and the capacity to morph into a mobile puddle of metallic liquid. However, her powers prove to be unpredictable (such as when her skin starts glowing brightly while she's nervous). She confides only in Annie and her best friend, Ray, choosing to keep her powers a secret from everyone else, including her parents, for fear of what the chemical plant CEO, Danielle Atron, will do to her if she finds out."

Small units, who have mastered the art of deception, and special techniques, have historically prevailed against overwhelming odds. The SHADOW FORCE team is the latest in this long tradition of special warriors. Their knowledge and understanding of this art, as well advance surveillance techniques and their military know how, gives them the edge to bring down bands of criminal operations. To succeed, they must also possess broad and in-depth knowledge about the history, government and customs of the countries they are operating in. The \"Shadwdow Force\" team is made up of five experts, all with distinct skill sets that make them uniquely qualified to carry out these dangerous missions: Bob Parr – The Shadow Force team leader is a counter-terrorism consultant and former member of the United Kingdom Special Forces and onetime Royal Marines Commando. sLiM – A former U.S. Special Forces member as well as Army Ranger, sLiM is the technical/tactical specialist of the team. Cobus Claassens – A Marine and Naval specialist, and former South African Special Forces, he is an expert in the West Africa region with 20 years of experience. Leonardo DiCaprio’s character in Blood Diamond was inspired by Claassens. Laura Engelbrecht – A diplomatic and Central African specialist, she was a U.S. State Department operations specialist and U.S. Embassy Political Attaché in the Congo. Ralph – A tracking and electronics expert and Rhidian Bridge, is a naval specialist who joins the team on specific missions. The team uses hard work and street smarts to take down bands of criminals, at times without any weapons, often when outnumbered, and always at their peril. At great odds stacked against them, the team makes a critical difference while facing desperate problems with potentially deadly consequences."

You'll love CHRIS because, well, everyone does. No drug is too obscure for him to try, and no sexual mountain too high for him to climb. Complicating everyone's life is the infamous TEA. She likes girls. And girls like her. What more is there to figure out... right? And let's not forget ABBUD, the not so devout Moslem and DAISY, the responsible one of the group who is just itching to break some rules of her own. Be it sex, drugs, the breadth of friendships or the depth of heartbreaks, Skins is an emotional mosh-pit that slams through the insanity of teenage years. They'll crush hearts and burn brain cells, while fearlessly confronting every obstacle head on...or slightly off."

Steve Turner (Michael Watson) was the other sleepwalker. In the first episode Ben Costigan (Jeffrey D. Sams) was introduced and he took over as the other sleepwalker when Steve was killed."

Previously, on their last sitcom, Two of a Kind, which lasted one season on ABC and was cancelled probably due to low ratings, they did not do crew work. (They probably did, but weren't credited...) But as time grew, they got older, and made a lot of movies on their own, such as Our Lips Are Sealed, a lot of \"Adventures of Mary-Kate & Ashley...,\" and Winning London. (They have the same first names as they do in So Little Time, but they have different last names.) They also released video games, and have their own magazine. Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen star as Riley and Chloe Carlson. So Little Time also stars Jesse Head, as Larry Slotnick, who serves as a best friend, but is love-struck with Riley, and would do anything for her. Clare Carey and Eric Lutes play Macy and Jake Carlson, Riley and Chloe's parents, who are both designers and are taking some time apart from each other. Jake, who lives alone in his trailer is quite happy, because he normally \"visits\" Macy, hangs out there, and eats her food. Taylor Negron serves as Manuelo, Macy's loosely based servant, and finally Natashia Williams stars as Teddie, Macy's supermodel friend, who models the clothes that Macy makes. So Little Time has its ups and downs. The up is Jesse Head, he is just so funny in the show, which makes it very entertaining when it's on. The down is Macy and Jake's characters are very reminiscent of Carrie and Kevin of Two of a Kind."

Having momentarily forgotten the word \"salt\", Peyo asked him (in French) to pass the schtroumpf. Franquin jokingly replied: \"Here's the Schtroumpf — when you are done schtroumpfing, schtroumpf it back...\" and the two spent the rest of that weekend speaking in \"schtroumpf language\".

What begins as a business relationship evolves into something more complex and compelling: a family unlike any we've ever seen. The three brothers find their dad-for-hire, RON SNUFFKIN (Tyler Labine, \"Reaper\"), at the local sporting good store. Ron will be forced to draw on a wide array of skills and a vast bag of tricks as he steps into the patriarch role to take care of the boys of the Gunderson family. ROBBY GUNDERSON (Davis Cleveland, \"How I Met Your Mother\"), 8, is a loose cannon who doesn't respond well to authority; GARY GUNDERSON (Frank Dolce, \"Doubt\"), 11, is a bright and street-savvy leader who is every bit the con man his father is; and BRANDON GUNDERSON (Troy Gentile, \"Entourage\"), 13, is a gentle free spirit who simply goes along for the ride. MAGGIE MORALES (Natalie Martinez, \"Saints & Sinners\"), Robby's second-grade teacher and the object of Ron's affection, might just be the only stable figure in the lives of this quirky quartet. While SONS OF TUCSON is grounded in the day-to-day challenges of a single-parent home, nothing in the Gunderson household is quite what it seems. An ongoing chess match between Ron and the boys will keep both parties on their toes, as neither side can afford to give up too much power or independence."

It was also compiled down into five movies, each composed of two episodes each, with new credit sequences. The series was written by renowned science fiction author Harlan Ellison under a pseudonym of Cordwainer Bird, with additional episodes being written by other sci-fi authors. The plot concerned a giant Noah's Ark-like spaceship, composed of hundreds of huge \"domes\", each containing a sample culture from the planet Earth, which has long since died out due to an unknown disaster. The Ark, damaged from an asteroid collision, goes off course and heads into the path of a distant sun, its crew dead.

    "description": "\"Stand by for Action! We're about to launch Stingray! Anything can happen within the next half hour!\" These were the words spoken by Commander Shore at the beginning of each episode of Stingray, the first Gerry Anderson Supermarionation show to be made in colour. Set in the year 2064, Stingray is about the World Aquanaut Security Patrol (WASP) who patrol the world's oceans, helping and defeating underwater races. The pride of WASP is the revolutionary submarine Stingray, which is controlled by Captain Troy Tempest and Lieutenant George Lee Sheridan, better known as \"Phones\". The WASP headquarters at Marineville, a huge complex, 10 miles inland. The heart of WASP operations is the control tower, where Commander Sam Shore, Lt. Atlanta Shore (also his daughter) and Sub-Lieutenant Fisher can control and communicate with the entire WASP organization. When Marineville is under surface attack, Battle Stations sound. What happens next is that the whole complex sinks beneath the ground on massive hydraulic platforms. Huge concrete blast doors then protect the base, as well as WASP Interceptor and hydraulic missiles. The WASP call is \"PWOR\" (Proceed With Orders Received). The main villain of the WASPs is Titan who rules the underwater city of Titanica and has sworn to invade the surface world. His slaves are the Aquaphibians, who control mechanical fish called Terror Fish, armed with deadly missiles that have destroyed many unsuspecting victims. Titan is also assisted by Surface Agent X20, who talks incredibly like Peter Lorre. X20 can infiltrate Marineville through cunning disguises. He lives in an old house on the Island of Lemoy, where he can communicate with Titanica by pressing a button in his living room, which changes the room into a communication centre within seconds! Before becoming a member of the WASPs, Marina, a tailless, voiceless mermaid was the slave of Titan before Troy Tempest rescued her from his clutches. Her father, Aphony is the ruler of the underwater city Pacifica. Marina and her people have been sworn to silence by Titan, who said if they were to speak again, they would be destroyed. Occasionally, Marina accompanies Troy and Phones on their missions and sometimes Atlanta goes in place of her if they feel the mission is unsuitable for Marina. Troy has love interests for both women. Rarely seen on missions is a seal named Oink. Each episode ended with a song called \"Aqua Marina\" which was composed by Barry Gray and sung by Gary Miller. Not only was Stingray the first Supermarionation series to be made in colour, it was also the first British TV series to be made in colour! The series has also been repeated on BBC 2 over 1992-4 and 2001/2 and recently on weekday mornings over 2003/4. It has also been shown on Sky One."

Executive producer Andy Harries gained hold of the novel and pitched a television adaption to Sky, even though he had not read it. Sky commissioned the series as part of a £10 million commitment to adapt novels into original dramas following the successes of adapting Terry Pratchett's Discworld novels. Following Cinemax's participation from the second series, the series faced a re-imagining due to the absence of first series lead Richard Armitage, who was at the time filming The Hobbit in New Zealand. Before filming several cast members participated in bootcamp training by former SAS and Special Boat Service (SBS) officers. The series was filmed on location in South Africa, although parts of the second series were filmed in Hungary."

Driven by a desire to succeed in this male dominated environment, her stand-offish behaviour also marks a soft centre, though few people get close enough to discover that.

Tabatha's Takeover will follow Coffey, the charismatic former Shear Genius contestant and Australian native, as she visits struggling salons in the Los Angeles and New York areas and literally takes over the establishments to whip them into shape. Coffey brings her no-nonsense approach to the salon owners and stylists, all teetering on the verge of collapse and in dire need of her skilled business direction. With just a week to work her magic, can she put these salons back on their feet or is it time for the shops to put up the closed sign for good? At first meeting, the owners and stylists find Coffey's distinct personality and wicked comments jarring; but they soon figure out that in order to be a success in the competitive high-end beauty business, they need to take the savvy and fearless approach that has helped Coffey's own career flourish. Coffey takes her training and the training of other hairdressers very seriously, and this passion drives her sincere quest to turn these salons around. Coffey's intensity for the business is clear in her unswerving dealings with the salon owners and stylists, sometimes driving them to tears as her critical eye probes the salons' customer service, cleanliness, professionalism, and overall styling techniques. She will also make her recommendations for which stylists should raise their rates, and which ones should be let go in order for the businesses to get to the next level as high-end establishments. The end results are often dramatic and inspire all those who have come in contact with Coffey to strive for only the best."

A creation which resulted in a world-wide successful television drama that has lasted for over twenty years. With over eighty episodes currently in the can the series, which follows the exploits of Maryhill CID, continues to win over viewers old and new despite major changes in the cast which caused most in the business to write it off. Since the pilot episode \"Killer\", the only installment to not carry the trade mark name, to the most recently aired episode, the show has presented more grizzly murders and plot twists than even the most ardent of fans can remember. Its film noir quality along with the stunning setting of Glasgow, the second city of the empire, that helps it remain a success even after all these years. The excellent cast, both present and past, have provided characters which have become much loved and remain in the hearts of fans even after their departure. This guide is dedicated to the memories of Mark McManus, Iain Anders, Robert Robertson, and Tom Watson. Taggart is now 20 years old becoming the longest running police drama on television the show is still as popular as it was when Mark McManus was at the helm.

Taking the Flak is a comedy drama about how journalists in war zones live in a state of perpetual danger not just from bombs but from disease, dysentery, bedbugs, bugged beds, their colleagues, their competitors and their loved ones, who are out of sight and out of mind. If they can't get themselves embedded with the army, they'll get embedded with each other. The team includes the smooth, veteran correspondent; the harassed, but infinitely resourceful, producer; and the green and gauche rookie stringer, dropped into a hotel and forced to choose between a room on 'the shooting side' and 'the mortar side'. Football-mad boy soldiers, corrupt car dealers, intestinal discomfort, unexploded landmines, old flames, impromptu hostage situations, YouTube viral videos and colossal egos all combust under the African sun.

It revolves around the intertwined lives of the Kovac and Williams families and their network of friends and extended family. TANGLE is about two generations of two families colliding, connecting... sometimes at cross-purposes as they navigate their way around the maze of love, sex, money and politics. Tim Williams has the world at his feet. Tipped for a top job in Cabinet, he is well on his way to becoming Premier. With a happy marriage, a good relationship with his teenage son and respect from his peers, his future is looking great. There’s only one little problem: 15 years ago, Tim had a brief, ill judged affair with drug-loving wild-child Nat Manning. The affair ended in pregnancy. After confessing to his wife Christine, they patched up their marriage and fought bitterly for custody of the child, Max. Nat fled to London and has barely been heard from since. Now 10 years on, Nat is a mere smear on the landscape of the Williams’ hard won, happy lives. But Nat is back … and there is a secret undercurrent to the world into which she returns. Her sister, Ally, is living in domestic oblivion. Unaware that her husband, Vince, is having an affair, Ally is also blind to the fact that his best friend, Gabriel, is in love with her. She is oblivious to Vince’s plans: a builder with ambition to jump into the big league, Vince can almost smell the possibility of a life of power, money and sex. If Tim Williams is going to climb the political ladder, then Vince is determined to extract his own benefits through their secret family connection. But Nat has a way of exposing what’s hidden. And through it all, the teenage children of Ally and Vince, Nat, Tim and Christine, and Vince’s mistress Em, are busily creating their own generation of chaos as they discover sex, danger, and the thrills of oncoming adulthood."

Thirteen people compete to \"stay alive\" as they face their deepest fears in an all-out elimination competition and scare-fest. Pitted against each other in situations straight from the horror movies, the 13 will face shocking surprises, psychological scares and lots of \"beware of the dark\" moments, all designed by a \"mastermind\" of terror. In addition to frightening them, he'll also entice individuals to work in concert with him and against the others, creating a situation in which the 13 will not only look over their shoulders but will also never be certain who is real before them. Each week, one unlucky victim will be \"killed off\" via frightening challenges and game-playing until only one person is left to win the grand prize of - fittingly - $66,666. \"13 – Fear Is Real\" is produced by Magic Molehill Productions, Inc. and Warner Horizon Television Inc. in association with Jay Bienstock Productions and Ghost House Pictures with executive producers Jay Bienstock ( \"Survivor,\" \"The Apprentice\" ), Sam Raimi (the \"Spider-Man\" films, \"The Evil Dead\" films) & Robert Tapert ( \"The Evil Dead\" films, \"The Grudge\" films)."

Now they are joined by a magnificent warlock called Vincent Van Ghoul, who is a cartoon cariature of Vincent Price (who also provided the voice), and a mischievous boy named Flim-Flam. Together they have to catch 13 ghosts and put them in a magical \"Chest of Demons\" that Scooby and Shaggy were tricked into opening by two sneaky ghosts named Weerd and Bogel. This was the last cartoon series that the original Scooby-Doo gang (minus Fred and Velma) appeared in for nearly 20 years. In 1988, the entire gang returned to TV as children in A Pup Named Scooby Doo, but they wouldn't resurface again weekly in their adult form until 2002 in What's New Scooby-Doo?."

Often using feature-film techniques, their brand of what could be called \"reality\" television tackled not only the small subjects, but the big ones too, all the way from life to death, as they followed their characters on the road from the idealism of youth to the search for security and responsibility as they glided toward middle age."

The brain is like a wire box, and the patient is not important because that is just the outside. Dr. Jonathan Seger (Mark Feuerstein) has a totally different point-of-view.

However, dealing with donor families in their darkest hour and managing the fears and concerns of apprehensive recipients takes much more than just a sharp scalpel. Leading the elite team is Dr. Andy Yablonski (Alex O'Loughlin), the highly-skilled workaholic lead organ transplant surgeon, whose good-natured personality and sarcastic wit makes him popular with his patients and colleagues. His colleagues include Dr. Miranda Foster (Katherine Moennig), a surgical fellow with a rebellious streak and fiery temper who strives to live up to her deceased father's excellent surgical reputation; Dr. David Lee (Daniel Henney), a womanizing surgical resident who's broken as many hearts as he's replaced; Ryan Abbott (Christopher J. Hanke), the inexperienced new transplant coordinator who arranges the intricately choreographed process of quickly and carefully transporting organs from donor to patient; Dr. Sophia Jordan (Julia Ormond, unaired pilot), the head of surgery and a dedicated medical professional; and Pam Acosta (Justina Machado), Andy's no-nonsense operating assistant and best friend. In this high stakes arena, in which every case is a race against the clock, these tenacious surgeons and medical professionals are the last hope for their patients."

The Earth is now populated by mutant monsters and is ruled by the 7 Citadels of Sorcery, a group of evil sorcerors who use a combination of magic and highly advanced technology to rule over the hapless populace. The stories revolve around the trio of Thundarr, Ariel and Ookla, as they make their way through this world, defeating evil wherever they may find it, their motivation being that they themselves recently escaped the clutches of the vile sorcerer Sabien, Ariel's evil stepfather. This world of the future is littered with half-destroyed 20th century relics, and many of the episodes take place in recognizable locales such as New York City or Mount Rushmore that have been changed in violent ways. Much of the show's humor revolves around the characters' relative lack of knowledge of our time period."

Using an often unpredictable number of voice and print clues, The Book transports Joe and his friends Fred and Sam to a variety of different times and places, from Camelot's medieval court of knights and dragons to the year 2105, where they meet their own great-granddaughters. The only way they are able to return present-day Brooklyn, New York is to find The Book again within whatever time period they are in. Later in the series, Joe's evil uncle, Mad Jack, makes several attempts to capture the children and The Book with his crafty tricks, whether stranding them in Antarctica (where the book doesn't work) or trying to make their new home in China (during the Tang Dynasty)."

Audrey is soon annoyed that her position on the estate has been usurped - and by a man who represents everything Audrey regards as bad taste. It's clearly a love-hate relationship from the beginning, but between foiling DeVere's plans and bringing his ego down a notch or two, Audrey manages to stamp her authority on the running of the Manor while the faint whisper of romance echoes across the way."

In a new twist this season, each Master will have his or her sous chef compete in an online competition, “Battle of the Sous Chefs,” hosted by Hugh Acheson. The results of each online episode directly impacts the Masters, awarding them advantages, such as immunity (the winner of each battle earns the Top Chef Master immunity), and sometimes, disadvantages, depending on their sous chef’s performance (the chefs who perform the worst always earn obstacles for their Top Chef Master). Every episode of “Battle of the Sous Chefs” leads up to the next episode of Top Chef Masters, and explores the uniquely interdependent relationship between a Master chef and his or her sous chef. Celebrity chef Curtis Stone is back as series host alongside new head critic Gail Simmons, with returning judges James Oseland, Ruth Reichl, and Francis Lam, and new judge, food and dining editor Lesley Suter. The chefs face off in some of the most difficult and unique challenges seen thus far -- and they’re serving up food for some top entertainers and celebrity guest judges including: Busy Philipps, Kathie Lee Gifford, Lindsay Price, the cast of Days Of our Lives, Ali Larter, the cast of Yo Gabba Gabba, LA Cult Favorites Lucha Va Voom among others. To date, Top Chef Masters has given over 1 million dollars to charities with this season increasing that total to over 1.25 million dollars. The series pits 13 world-renowned chefs against each other to see how well they fare in fierce culinary competition. Each week will whittle down the chefs until the finale where one winner is crowned “Top Chef Master” and receives the grand prize of $100,000 for their charity."

Vinnie falls into a job at Rolling Hills country club, where he becomes very popular with ladies; however, most of them are old and married. And as with any spin-off series, characters from the parent series would often make an appearance to start the show off on a higher ratings note, which in this series didn't help. Not one to give in, Ron Leavitt, co-creator of Married... With Children has brought Vinnie's character back in the spring of '92 with a series called Vinnie & Bobby; this series is chronicled in another entry."

    "description": "Lynda La Plante presents a new way of looking at a crime drama in Trial And Retribution. Most crime dramas consist of the investigation or the trial, but the series includes the crime, investigation and the trial. The series is a gritty and serious drama that centres around the crimes, its detection and the characters who are involved in the crime and investigation. David Hayman stars as Detective Superintendent (later Det. Chief. Supt.) Mike Walker alongside Kate Buffery as Detective Inspector Pat North. They investigate serious and hard-hitting crimes and the series is still as popular as it originally was. In the seventh installment in the series, D.I. North was replaced by Detective Chief Inspector Roison Connor, played by Victoria Smurfit. The series was originally made as annual one-offs up until series IX in 2005. The tenth series was originally planned to be shown in the autumn of 2006, but in early 2006 ITV commissioned a further four series, claiming that it was the crime drama they'd been looking for. Series X was held over and in January 2007, all five instalments were broadcast over five consecutive weeks. Due to the larger load of producing four new instalments, this was the first time in her career that La Plante had to call in other writers. For series XII and XIII (and continuing into future instalments), two different writers worked on storylines she had suggested. Lynda La Plante said she was very protective over the series and its characters, and found it difficult to slightly let go, though the major commission was quite an achievement. The series is currently Lynda La Plante's longest running series and both ITV and La Plante Productions continue to be enthusiastic to continue the series, as after fourteen feature-length two-part instalments it is still highly popular. A further commission of five two-parters was made in 2007, now cut to an hour per episode due to ITV's new plans for hour-long programming during weekdays. Series XV-XIX began in January 2008. In an interview with a TV Guide, David Hayman said D.C.I. Connor is ready to take over from Walker now, perhaps suggesting Walker will be talking more of a back-seat in the storylines of the present series than in the past."

He picks a theme for the day (Caveman Day, Western Day, Astronaut Day, Mexicans Day) and encourages his \"Anipals\" (His animal puppets) to do stuff for the day that corresponds with the theme. Of course, they never do and get themselves in crazy situations like going to a Tijuanese Bordello and Doug is stuck on the set all alone. There's also Robert Smigel cartoons and mock-educational films! Robert Smigel is best known as the voice of Triumph The Insult Comic Dog which is originally from Conan O'Brian."

Or anyway it was until Dudley Puppy showed up! Don't take that the wrong way. Dudley -- a mutt with the best of every doggie gene pool -- is a crime-fighting superstar. With the speed of a greyhound, the nose of a bloodhound and the punch of a boxer, he can't be stopped. But he's still a sloppy, excitable pup and he goes MAD for bones -- a weakness that is constantly landing Dudley and his purrfect partner Kitty Katswell in the claws of Verminious Snaptrap. Verminious is the wicked rat mastermind of the Diabolical Order Of Mayhem, or as cowering pets everywhere call it, D.O.O.M.! Along with such crusty comrades like Francisco the man-munching alligator, the shape-shifting Chameleon and feather-headed Bird Brain, Verminious keeps the streets of Petropolis crawling with evil schemes."

However they are sent back as someone other than themselves but with the full knowledge of their mission of their own redemption. In addition, they only have three days to change that life path. The judge also provides them with a guide, who is also recently deceased but is deemed by God to have a mission of assistance before his final fate is determined. Although always visible to the person he is assisting, the guide has the ability to be seen or not be seen by those around him, his invisibility when he wears the clothes in which he died."

The executive changes their appearance and assumes an alias and fictional back-story. The fictitious explanation for the accompanying camera crew is that the executive is being filmed as part of a documentary about entry-level workers in a particular industry. They spend approximately one week undercover, working in various areas of the company's operations, with a different job and in most cases a different location each day. The boss is exposed to a series of predicaments with amusing results. They invariably spend time getting to know the people who work in the company, learning about their professional and personal challenges. At the end of their week undercover, the boss returns to their true identity and requests the employees he worked with individually to corporate headquarters. The boss reveals their identity and rewards hardworking employees through campaign, promotion or financial rewards. Other employees are given training or better working conditions."

The wisecracking brothers, who have an obsession with numbers, travel across the country to uncover hidden facts about the nation and its residents. The use of computer technology and infographics help bring the numbers to life for viewers. Statistics featured in the show include information about money (how much we make and how we spend it), free time (what we do with it and how to make more of it) and how much time Americans spend, or perhaps waste, in traffic -- hint: it's in the billions of hours annually.

What if the worst day of your life began your life's greatest adventure? Meet Nikko Zond, a hyper-intelligent but rebellious teenager still… More mourning the death of his renowned archeologist mother and a virtual stranger to his workaholic father, Solomon. On the day Nikko gets kicked out of the latest in a long line of boarding schools, he discovers his father's career as a university professor is just a cover. Solomon is really head of the Veritas Foundation, whose agenda is to seek the truth behind the mysteries of history and civilization. Teaming up for the first time with his father, Nikko finds his parents' spirit of adventure clearly runs in his blood, as he inadvertently gets entangled in his dad's dangerous adventures. Soon, and against his father's better judgment, Nikko enters the high tech, classified world of Veritas and begins the adventure of his lifetime - a journey that will lead to the unlocking of universal mysteries and, hopefully, will bring him and his emotionally estranged father back together. The Veritas team includes: The highly intelligent and mysterious Vincent Siminou, Solomon's closest confidant and protector; Calvin Banks, a high strung but brilliant by-the-books archaeologist; and Maggie, a cool and sophisticated computer scientist. And charged with the difficult task of trying to keep Nikko out of trouble is Juliet Droil, a beautiful and brilliant former student of his father's who will be Nikko's tutor and friend. From an excavation site of the pre-Roman civilization of Ancient Gaul to the North Pole, there is no place to which the Veritas Foundation will not venture in their mission for the truth. But a secret nefarious organization, seeking to destroy the Foundation's research, will never be far behind. The series stars Ryan Merriman as Nikko Zond, Alex Carter as Solomon Zond, Eric Balfour as Calvin Banks, Cynthia Martells as Maggie, Cobie Smulders as Juliet Droil with Arnold Vosloo as Vincent Siminou. \"Veritas\" was created by Patrick Massett and John Zinman (\"Tomb Raider\") who will serve as writers and executive producers.

Each episode tracks our bikers as they attempt to solve their problems in their own way.

After Scott is moved by a terminally ill neighbour's request to die - and at the same time faced with a predatory female employer, a split from his girlfriend, and a desperate life or death need for cash to pay off his brother Joey's gambling debts - he and his best mate Cozzo stumble towards what they think is their only solution: an assisted-suicide machine. A deeply illegal situation about which they will have to keep very, very quiet. Along the way, the 20-something mates find love in the strangest ways, fall out with each other and are touched by some of the people they come across.

These are the animals that Nick Baker has been longing to track down ever since his childhood days when he was ''dumped'' at the world-class repository of zoological wonders, the British Natural History Museum in South Kensington. Nick always found himself drawn to the most extreme, absurd and unusual exhibits. Some would dismiss these oddities as freaks of nature, but for Nick, these are the unsung heroes of evolutionary biology."

What follows is a crash course in culture blending as Molly and Junior decide they want to get married, thus bringing together two very different families. The dads have the most difficult time reconciling while the moms take a softer approach.

Taking us to all corners of Australia and the globe are six stories of individuals seeking to find the definitive answer to where they came from. Along the way secrets are uncovered and histories are revealed—from adultery and madness to children born out of wedlock and even the whiff of a right royal scandal—with each individual discovering that their ancestors form an integral part of not only their own identity, but that of the nation. Combining emotional and personal journeys with big-picture history, these inspiring and sometimes challenging stories remind us how Australians have come to be the people that we are today. Considering Australia’s multicultural background, this is a global story, with each celebrity tracing their ancestors around the world. They travel to the places where their forebears would have lived, loved and died, and learn about the hardships and hurdles their ancestors overcame. This is a fascinating chronicle of the social, ethnic and cultural evolution of Australia’s national identity."

    "description": "Richie Adler (Matthew Laborteaux) lives with his mother and sister; his parents are divorced, and his father works overseas, often in the Middle East, as a telecommunications engineer/consultant to several firms located there. Richie is an advanced computer user with cutting edge skills. Presumably he has inherited these abilities as well as most of his computer equipment from his father. He acquires obsolete equipment that was scheduled to be scrapped and sends it to Richie. He even sends a programmable robot, Herman. Richie collects this equipment and connects and assembles it to form RALF, his pet name for his computer system. RALF has multiple components and capabilities, including a camera which produces a primitive facial identification system. Richie and his friends come across mysteries which they (mainly Richie) attempt to solve using his computer skills with RALF's power. Guidance is often provided by newspaper reporter Farley (their mentor). The cases often involved money-hungry criminals working inside business or government who would assault and murder people to cover-up their deeds. There were also a few episodes involving spies of the Soviet Union. Lew Farley (Max Gail) is a reporter for the fictional newspaper the LA Gazette (although on the first episode the reporter is named Gallagher and he is played by Michael Horton). Many of his stories are exposés of crime and corruption. He is well connected and seems to know everyone from gangsters to beat cops to a mysterious patriarch. He has a cantankerous but mutually beneficial relationship with Lieutenant Quinn (A Martinez) who is head of the detective unit, and also married to Farley's sister. Farley was a Vietnam-era anti-war protester who was jailed and beaten on occasion during marches. He was inspired to journalism by a woman whose death he investigates in \"The Wrong Mr. Wright\". Farley is somewhat technologically capable (carrying around one of the first laptops ever sold, a Gavilan SC), but he relies on Richie for complicated technical help. He warns the Whiz Kids of danger and helps them when they get in over their heads with criminal elements or with the government. He is often the first person they call when they are trouble, and Richie's mother leans on him as well. In most episodes, the three groups -- the police (mostly led by Quinn), the media (usually Farley), and the Whiz Kids -- wind up all contributing to cracking a case and in bringing the criminals to justice. Their relationship is often conflicted, as Quinn must keep Farley from getting too much insider information, while Farley and Quinn must keep the kids out of danger. However, each case is never solved by one group alone, and they are all usually forced by circumstance to work together, each drawing on their own particular strengths. Richie's father is a telecommunications engineer who often works abroad and is mostly absent. He does drop in town occasionally, however. He is well connected in high level Washington political circles, something that Richie's mother alludes to and uses. Richie's mother and father are divorced, but their relationship is portrayed as still positive and friendly. She also keeps his name and refers to herself as Mrs. Adler. She says that she thinks his job-required traveling is what led to their divorce. Richie's mother is somewhat strict and does not allow his genius level abilities to influence her duty as a mother. She makes him clean up the messes he and his buddies cause with their various hijinks, and she does not let him shirk his schoolwork, chores, or other responsibilities. (Nor does his teacher: in \"Red Star Rising\", their being applauded by the CIA does not get three of them off the hook for not completing a homework assignment - Alice is spared, since she actually did it!) Richie's little sister Cheryl provides comic relief in most episodes, but she does have a few important scenes of insight or family drama. There is a slight love triangle between Richie, Ham, and Alice. Alice is a bit of a hacker herself, but she receives little respect or extra attention from Richie, which bothers her greatly. Ham really likes Alice, but she (for the most part) does not return his attentions. On the whole, the teens do not get a whole lot of character development. Most of the episode time is taken dealing with the complicated plots, criminals exposition, Lew and Quinn, chase scenes, and hacking scenes (which are almost totally focused on Richie). However Jeremy is shown to be rather clever in his own right and the kids are involved in many activities, including go-kart racing, sports, ballet, and music. There is also a bit of a conflict between Richie and the others, as he can sometimes be domineering or arrogant, although they typically reconcile. Source: Wikipedia"

    "description": "This unique legal drama chronicles the way a case is built from the perspective of both the defense and prosecution. Showing each side equally keeps the audience guessing, shifting allegiances and opinions on guilt or innocence until the very final scene. Kathryn Peale, the product of a New England background and a sheriff father, is the Deputy Bureau Chief in the New York State District Attorney's office. Jimmy Brogan, born and raised in Hell's Kitchen and a friend of Kathryn's since their days at Yale Law School, is one of New York's rising criminal attorney stars. Buoyed by their respective teams, these evenly matched lawyers—each with a strong streak of competitiveness, a fervent belief in their clients and an equally intense passion for the law go about creating two different stories from the same set of facts. As this up-close, behind-the-scenes look at the legal process mirrors the excitement of a championship match, it becomes evident that truth has nothing to do with innocence or guilt—at the end of every trial, the only thing that matters is what the jury believes. The Whole Truth stars Rob Morrow (Numb3rs) as Jimmy Brogan, Eamonn Walker (Oz) as Sr. ADA Terrence \"Edge\" Edgecomb, Sean Wing as Chad Griffin, Anthony Ruivivar as Alejo Salazar and Christine Adams as Lena Boudreaux. The series is produced by Bonanza Productions Inc. in association with Jerry Bruckheimer Television and Warner Bros. Television. The pilot was written and co-executive produced by Tom Donaghy, and the executive producers are Jerry Bruckheimer and Jonathan Littman. Alex Graves was executive producer and director for the pilot, and KristieAnne Reed serves as a co-executive producer."

This offers contestants the chance to win by out-guessing 10 opponents in 10 fast-paced and dramatic trivia battles. At the start of the game, each player stands behind a coin whose value ranges between $1.00 and $50,000. The value of the coin is hidden from the players and will not be revealed until one of them loses and drops out of the game, literally. This is by falling through the trapdoor in the studio floor on which he or she is standing. Created by Craig Plestis (Minute to Win It), Tim Puntillo (Minute to Win It), and Avi Armoza, \"Who's Still Standing\" is a fresh idea of a game show that puts the contestants on the edge of winning of falling out of the competition."

Angie was Frankie's sister, and Stacy was Melissa's. Since the girls could basically be tending to their siblings at night, their neighbor, Larry, worked at KVGS as a news anchorman--was asked to please \"watch the kids\" during the daytime. Mitzi, the emcee at the club, was also the landlord of everyone. Bert Gunkel was Larry's clutsy cameraman, whom also lived in the apartment building and helped Larry watch the kids, and Memphis was the main attraction of Club Sand Pile."

Based on the exploits of real-life Toronto coronor Dr. Morton Shulman, Dr. Steve Wojeck was a medical examiner and tireless crusader against drug abuse, elderly abuse, police abuse, auto safety, Indian abuse, industrial abuse, etc. In short, a Canadian version of Quincy, M.E. that predated that show by a decade.

With unemployment an ongoing issue and women now outnumbering men in the workforce, the new comedy series \"Work It\" follows two alpha males who realize the only way to beat the current \"mancession\" and land a job in pharmaceutical sales is to pass themselves off as women. Combining all the best elements of the workplace comedy, the buddy comedy and the family comedy, \"Work It\" centers on Lee Standish (Ben Koldyke) -- a quick-witted and likable family man who used to be a top car salesman until he got laid off -- and Angel Ortiz (Amaury Nolasco) -- a single, hot-headed ladies' man with no filter -- who quickly learn there are fundamental differences in the worlds of men and women that go beyond teetering in high heels and tightening up with Spanx. Lee and Angel are determined to keep their ruse going for as long as they can -- and keep their newly found jobs - in this smart, funny and relevant look at male and female relationships at work, at home and socially. Being a better man sometimes means having to be a better woman."

The pub is run by brothers, the nervous Barry and the idiotic Garry. The only regulars of the pub are Bob and Dodgy Phil. Every episode revolves around one of Dodgy Phil's plans to improve the pub, a plan which Barry always has doubts about. The doubts are often confirmed due to the pub's destruction at the end of every episode. One of the running jokes in the series is that, as the pub is next to a zoo, unusual animals are often found inside it. The plot often follows the same formula; The pub is destroyed or needs rebuilding, and Dodgy Phil produces a scheme to re-launch the pub, which Barry disputes. Dodgy Phil telephones a friend, such as 'Mock Tudor Trev' or 'Logistical Nightmare Len', who arrives immediately to rebuild the pub, together with a set of characters represented by sound effects, and often Edith Piaf. The work is then finished in a short sound effect (often to the sound of Je ne regrette Rien). The plan is flawed, and the pub is destroyed or closed down at the end of each episode."
